      <p class="hangingindent"><strong>First&#058;</strong> Check your email for a message from <em>Atticus@TalesofMurder.com</em> with the subject <strong>"[CONFIRMATION REQUIRED] Please confirm your subscription."</strong> &mdash; <small>(note that it may take 10&#8208;15 mins to arrive, depening on, well, on the 'net and its mood!)</small></p>
      <p class="hangingindent"><strong>Second&#058;</strong> Click the CONFIRMATION link in that email. When you click that link, you'll be added to our daily or weekly digest email blast.</p>
      <p>I require this "double opt&#8208;in" to (1) protect you from nefarious evildoers who might add your email address without your premission! (2) make sure that the email address you entered is correct.</p>
      <p>If you don't confirm your subscription, I cannot send you want you asked for. I want to protect you, my other readers and the site, itself. I hope you understand. Besides, its easy!</p>

      <h3>While you wait on that confirmation email &hellip;</h3>
      <p>Let me explain a little more what you'll be getting with each issue&#058;</p>
      <h4>Daily Digest Subsribers</h4>
      <p>If you selected a daily digest, you'll get exactly <strong>ONE</strong> email from me each day, about mid&#8208;to&#8208;late afternoon. In that email, you'll find links to the two stories published that day. Just click, read &amp; enjoy. This option is great if you love to read murder mystery short stories (isn't that why you're here!) and want to get new stuff every day.</p>
      <p>You'll also get the weekly email, which has those extra short stories for subscribers only!</p>
      <h4>Weekly Digest Subscribers</h4>
      <p>If you selected the weekly digest, I'll send you an email every Sunday morning. In it, you'll find a full list of all stories published in the previous week. And, of course, those two longer exclusive stories.</p>
      <p>The weekly digest will also include, as needed, relevant news about the site (new features, etc.) and other things you'll find useful as a murder mystery fan.</p>
      <p>Plus, I'll throw in the occasional extra, like a serialized novel, or special event notifications. And, as always, I respect your inbox so I'll never send extra emails (unless dire circumstances require it &hellip; that'll be rare!); nor will I ever sell your email address. I take the security of my friends and clients very seriously!</p>
      <p>Finally, if you ever get tired of the emails, you can adjust to only the weekly email digest or opt out completely. No hard feelings.</p>
      <p class="specialnote"><strong>One more little item&#058;</strong> I'm also developing a paid magazine for murder mystery subscribers. It'll be the kind of thing that you can read on your iPad or Kindle device (or any other) and will be monthly, for a small subscription price. Let me know if you might be interested by entering your email address. When it is ready to launch, I'll send you a quick note so you can learn more.</p>

      <p class="specialnote">I'm very exited that you've decided to join TalesofMurder.com. I'm sure you'll love my little murder mysteries! &mdash; Atticus</p>
