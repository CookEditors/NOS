        <title>The Motive</title>

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having decided upon our characters, our crime, and our weapon, let us consider next the motive for the crime. Of course in all crimes except murder, the motive is obvious; for who would commit a robbery except to obtain the booty? Who would commit arson except with the intent of destroying property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a murder story the motive is one of the principal parts of the mystery. It has been said that there are only three motives for murder: money, love and revenge. While this is true in a general way, there are many other specific motives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Train's book, &quot;Courts, Criminals and the Camorra,&quot; there is a most interesting chapter devoted to this question of motive. Though it is impossible to quote it all, we will refer to his published record compiled by a man who had been trying murder cases for ten years. Several pages tell the details of the record, but a concise summing up is also given. We are told, &quot;Out of the sixty-two homicides recorded, there were seventeen cold-blooded murders, with deliberation and premeditation; three homicides due to negligence; five committed while perpetrating a felony; thirty-seven manslaughters, due in sixteen cases to quarrels, thirteen to drink, four to disputes over money, three to women, one to race antagonism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further classification is given, and the whole chapter, indeed, the whole book, should be read by every writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a small percentage, however, of recorded murders are adaptable to fiction plots. A study of the causes of real murders is useful, if one has discrimination in choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motive in fiction must be picturesque if possible, and interesting in any case. We care little what ruffian murdered another in a back alley; but we are intensely curious to know who killed Mr. Leavenworth or the Widow Lerouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting motives are doubtless money, love and revenge; but the ramifications of these include hate, jealousy, greed, safety, ambition, inheritance and many others—in fact, the whole category of human emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally there is what might be called a freakish motive, such as the homicidal mania of The Whispering Man; or the curious motive of the criminal in the &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are sporadic instances. The soundest motives are the best, and in most cases the soundest are the simplest. Murder is the result of one of the most primitive impulses in man; and though the working out of the plot may be subtle, it is wise, so far as is possible, to have the motive simple, straightforward and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If consistent with the plot, let the motive be of recent date. It is annoying to discover at the end of the book that the motive is retaliation for a wrong done thirty or forty years ago, as in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; or &quot;Hand and Ring.&quot; These, otherwise perfect and really great detective stories, finally reveal motives which could not possibly be discovered by the reader, however much he might guess at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the motive be as carefully concealed as you like, but offer adroit hints and veiled allusions that the astute reader may catch if he can, and when at last the motive is revealed, let it be a logical and sound one, and, above all, let it be adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Handling of the Crime</title>
        <description>&lt;section id=&quot;toc&quot; class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h6&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;drawer&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of the murder is a point to be carefully chosen and this consideration of course includes the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shooting is perhaps the means most often used, with stabbing as a close second. If a shooting, the weapon is usually a revolver, or occasionally a rifle. In this case, care must be taken that the scene is out of doors; or, if indoors, in an isolated apartment or so placed that the report shall be out of hearing of the other characters, unless immediate discovery is intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various devices are used to keep the innocent characters from hearing the shooting. In one case only a half-charge of powder was put into a gun. In another, of recent date, a silent bullet was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong point is always made of the evidence of the weapon, if it be found. But, as we have before hinted, do not persist in having the revolver marked with the initials of a perfectly innocent person, for this has come to be looked upon as a tacit acquittal. It is hackneyed, also, to have the pistol one of a pair, and trace it by means of its duplicate still reposing in its case in the criminal's library. Learn to avoid these over-worked devices, as there are surely plenty of others. If a pistol is your chosen weapon, treat it either inconspicuously, or in some novel and original fashion that will interest the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a stabbing is principally that the weapon may be picked up at the moment, in a sudden impulse to kill; while a pistol usually implies a premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weapon picked up on the spot has the advantage of not necessitating its concealment after use, for it incriminates no one in particular. Oftenest this weapon is a dagger used as a paper cutter, and so lying at hand on a table. Or a dagger or sword which is one of a decorative group on the wall of the room. Another weapon which has crept into use of late y ears is the hatpin. This, though popular among writers, is implausible and in many cases impossible; for the average hatpin bends but does not break. Yet one author after another kills his victim by stabbing him with a hatpin which breaks off and disappears in the wound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would-be clever author caused his victim to fall violently forward (with his mouth conveniently open), and allow a hatpin held by a near-by lady to strike through the roof of his mouth and pierce his brain. The obliging hatpin broke off at just the right place, and as the lady concealed the head end, the point end of the fatal weapon was never discovered. This related incident is practically impossible and should not have been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Spanish story called &quot;The Nail,&quot; by Pedro de Alargon, practically reverses this method. A large nail was driven into the victim's skull and accomplished its purpose immediately. The head of the nail was concealed by the man's thick hair, and all unsuspecting of villainy, three medical experts declared the man's death due to apoplexy. Nor were they entirely to blame, as the physical effects brought about by the nail were precisely the same as the conditions of death by apoplexy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nail is a horrible suggestion, but whatever weapon brings about violent death is necessarily horrible. It is wise to dwell on the physical details as little as possible. Granted a murder, there must be a method, and if the exigencies of the story demand a horrible method, so be it; but remember Poe's injunction, and when painting the decayed cheeses make them look as little like decayed cheeses as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poison is a method giving the author a wider scope and necessitating somewhat legs gruesome conditions. It is easier to administer poison than to shoot or stab. Poison may be given in food or drink, or introduced into medicine or administered in more ingenious and original ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this method is used, the author should study up on poisons and their effects, and not run the risk of making absurd mistakes in his text. Abstruse scientific information is not necessary; enough can be learned from an encyclopaedia or a medical dictionary; but the plausibilities must be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite poison with writers who know little of the subject, is &quot;a curious Indian or Persian drug, which acts instantaneously and leaves no trace.&quot; This drug, with its various and unintelligible names, has been somewhat over-worked; but it is acceptable because of its mystery and it is useful because its description is so vague as to need no real knowledge of it on the part of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of a poison murder implies more complexities than a death by shooting or stabbing. The poisoner is a person of more ingenuity and is more anxious to escape discovery; and it also gives scope for treachery and deceit. Then, too, it has the advantage of allowing the detail of bloodshed to be omitted, thus making the scene less ghastly to sensitive minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drowning and strangling and chloroforming eliminate also the necessity for bloodshed, and have the added advantage of requiring no especial weapon; though the presence of the weapon, or the absence of one known to have been used, is a valuable asset to the mystery writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the principal means of murder are enumerated above, the various manifestations of these means are innumerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambitious writer often strives to find some new and original way of committing a hackneyed crime. So far has this been carried, that the latest detective stories employ the use of cultures of typhoid or diphtheria to bring about the necessary demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such means are perfectly legitimate in detective fiction, and if detailed with accurate and correct scientific knowledge are convincing, though not picturesque. Sherlock Holmes, with his fancy for the bizarre, rarely is satisfied with a plain shooting or stabbing. He uses such means as a blunt weapon, pushing into the water, a venomous snake, a harpoon, a poker, charcoal fumes, and a fall from a steep precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Anna Katharine Green's best stories, &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; employs the homely weapon of a billet of fire-wood. We are told at the outset that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Half the criminals are caught because they do make tracks and then resort to such extraordinary means to cover them up. The true secret of success in this line lies in striking your blow with a weapon picked up on the spot, and in choosing for the scene of your tragedy a thoroughfare where, in the natural course of events, other men will come and go and unconsciously tread out your traces, provided you have made any. This dissipates suspicion, or starts it in so many directions that justice is at once confused, if not ultimately baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sound principle of construction, and is the starting point of many of the best detective stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; the author goes back to the primitive weapon of a mutton bone, and in the skillful hands of both author and criminal this weapon is truly dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An author's first plot almost invariably centers around a shooting or a stabbing affair. It is in his later efforts that he feels moved to vary his methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding crimes other than murder, we find that more depends on the setting. A robbery, however great the booty, must be made interesting by unusual characters or conditions, and must implicate the hero or other important characters to the danger point. The discovery of the wrong-doer must mean disgrace and disaster of the strongest sort. For your detective story fancier is an extremist; and, owing to the predominance of murder stories and capital punishment, a short imprisonment for a robbery seems tame by contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a robbery story, but it combines all the elements that make for a dramatic setting, and though not the main motive, it includes a murder, and also a suicide, incidentally in the plot. It is one of the very few full-sized novels built upon a robbery, and it required the peculiar genius of a Wilkie Collins to hold the reader's attention through its five hundred pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other crimes than those we have considered, such as forgery, arson, blackmail, etc., are used only by authors in search of a novelty. They fancy that these crimes will interest because they are not so hackneyed as murder and robbery. But unless worked up with great care as to atmosphere and technique, stories of these crimes often prove dull reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some authors incline to such subjects as Nihilism and the workings of secret societies. These are not of such general interest as the ones we have been discussing, but they offer picturesque possibilities and scope for melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the construction of our story we must consider the question of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;length&quot;&gt;Length&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and in the opinion of many authorities best there is the short-story. With exceptions, the best mystery stories are short-stories. A short-story lends itself peculiarly to a mystery plot, principally because it is not easy to keep wonder and curiosity alive through a long story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, many detective stories fall naturally into the length of a novelette—say 30,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a two-or three-part story, which differs from the novelette in construction, even when of the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form is the serial, in which each installment must have its own climax, all leading to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last of all, there is the full-sized book, where the interest may or may not be broken before the denouement and solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-short-story-and-the-novel&quot;&gt;The Short-Story and the Novel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of making many books concerning and dissecting the short- story there is no end. As many probably there are regarding the construction of the novel; and between these two forms they tell us there is a great gulf fixed. But the fixing of this gulf is largely a matter of opinion, and the opinions are somewhat diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One writer explains the intrinsic difference between a short- story and a story that is merely short. He holds that a short- story is by no means a condensed novel, but is different in kind from a novel. The novelette, however, he contends is a brief novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writer, following this distinction, goes so far as to say that were the novelette condensed to one half or less of its usually accepted length it would still be a novel and not a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, were a short-story expanded indefinitely it could never become a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of this distinction lies in the principle that a short-story is founded on a unity of impression. It relates, more or less definitely, a single episode; while a novel is a series of correlated episodes, bearing on a single motive. The number of words in a piece of fiction has absolutely no part in determining its nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's distinction that a novel cannot be read at a sitting and a short-story can, is not entirely valid. For &quot;a sitting&quot; is surely a most uncertain division of time. To the busy man a sitting may be a half an hour; to the idle woman it may be half a day; while to the &quot;shut-in&quot; it is continuous and interminable. Moreover, in the case of a thrilling Mystery Story, a reader's sitting would be prolonged, even in spite of imperative duty calls, because of the desire to reach the solution of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as a distinction, we are told that the novel is expansive and the short-story intensive. Perhaps an illustration might be made by likening the novel to a map of the United States, and the short-story to a single state on the map viewed under a magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these differentiations regarding short-stories and novels are fully explained and discussed in books exclusively devoted to such technique. And though the fine distinctions therein drawn are of highest importance to other branches of fiction, they are almost, if not entirely, negligible in the case of Detective Stories. For the inherent difference between a novel and a short-story is one of plot. Whereas, since Detective Stories have but one solitary plot,—&quot;the problem and its solution,11—the difference in the detective short-story or the detective novel is merely that of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;singleness-of-plot-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;Singleness of Plot in the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single plot that makes a Detective Story may be likened to an accordion; it may be pulled out to an extraordinary length, or compressed to a minimum. A detective novel may have minor complications, more characterization and more elaborate setting; but the plot must not vary from the plot of a detective short-story, being only the propounding of the riddle and the revealing of its answer. The longer the story the more numerous and bewildering the conditions of the riddle and the windings of the maze, but all tend definitely to the one end,—the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short-story the plot rushes on breathlessly, bare and straight to its end. In a novelette there is more room for side- lights, more time for slower development, and more scope for minor issues; while a full-sized book still further amplifies these possibilities. But in these three forms the main thread must go on, without halt, in an ever rising crescendo of interest to the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the work is to be published in two or three parts, or if it is a longer serial, then the plan is so far changed as to present a definite climax at the end of each installment. But these must be all minor climaxes and all bearing successively and cumulatively on the final revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-length&quot;&gt;The Question of Length&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in writing detective fiction, unlike other kinds, the length of his story is entirely at the option of the author. For the detective plot possesses the characteristics of a piece of string; it differs from its fellows only in length. The story of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; could have been told in a hundred pages, but Wilkie Collins gives it five hundred. &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; could have been a full-sized book as well as &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; The inquest scene in the latter fills seventy pages, while Poe's story details the inquest in six pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's stories are short because he uses the single incident of the crime and the single impression of its solution, with an absence of any detail not absolutely necessary. Sherlock Holmes himself, who is often a medium for his author's views, says that he could do in twenty-four hours detective work on which Lecoq occupied six months. This is true enough, but the reason is that, as we have previously pointed out, Lecoq figured in a novel while Sherlock had to do his work expeditiously in the confines of a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau chose to write novels, and so in connection with the problem and its solution he makes use of side issues of all sorts; even including the past history of his characters, subordinate plots, and various byways of conjecture or misleadings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see the length of a Mystery Story is entirely at the pleasure of the performer, without the hampering rules laid down for the writers of ether types of fiction. Say the plot depends upon a cypher interest. Conan Doyle did the story of the &quot;Dancing Men&quot; in a short-story; Poe's &quot;Gold Bug&quot; is a novelette; while James DeMille's &quot;The Cryptogram&quot; is a very long book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be because Detective Stories are the work of artisans rather than artists that they can be fitted to such a Procrustean bed of literature. But though a sponge may be the size of your head or compressed to the size of your fist, it is the same sponge and comprises and includes the same material and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this general principle must be taken with limitations. Some of Conan Doyle's short-stories could not be made into satisfactory books, while others could easily be. As in other fiction, a slight incident is not enough for a novel, but a great incident is. A missing Christmas goose might not be of sufficient interest to fill a book, when a murder mystery is. Perhaps w e may say a simple mystery indicates a short-story length, while a complex riddle, or one made complex by side issues means a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it is here that art steps in. A master hand can make a great interest out of a simple mystery, where a tyro could not succeed. Generally speaking, the short-story must differ from the novel in scope and structure. In detective fiction it differs in scope only; for the main structure is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers of the technique of fiction tell us that another difference between the short-story and the novel lies in the fact that the novel must be a love story, while the short-story need not deal with romance at all. Applied to detective fiction, this may be adapted to mean that a love interest is possible, though not imperative in a novel or a novelette; but a short-story has no reason for romance and no room for it, unless it is a necessary premise to the conditions of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of absolute measurement, perhaps we may call four thousand words an ideal length for a short-story. A novelette should be thirty or thirty-five thousand words long; while a book may run as near as you wish to one hundred thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of Poe's &quot;Gold Bug,&quot; nearly fifteen thousand words, would not be an acceptable size to editors of the present day. And though great writers may be a law unto themselves in this matter, it is wise to arrange a story in accordance with the editors' preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houdini, the magician, in speaking of his own principles of legerdemain, said: &quot;It is more difficult to support admiration than to excite it,&quot; and so it is more difficult to hold an intellectual curiosity than to arouse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his introduction to an excellent collection of mystery stories, Mr. Julian Hawthorne has written so discerningly on this subject that we quote from his article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I need hardly point out that there is a distinction and a difference between short riddle stories and long ones—novels. The former require far more technical art for their proper development; the enigma cannot be posed in so many ways, but must be stated once for all; there cannot be false scents, or but a few of them; there can be small opportunity for character drawing, and all kinds of ornament and comment must be reduced to their very lowest terms. Here, indeed, as everywhere, genius will have its way; and while a merely talented writer would deem it impossible to tell the story of 'The Gold Bug1 in less than a volume, Poe could do it in a few thousand words, and yet appear to have said everything worth saying. In the case of the Sherlock Holmes tales, they form a series, and our previous knowledge of the hero enables the writer to dispense with much description and accompaniment that would be necessary had that eminent personage been presented in only a single complication of events. Each special episode of the great analyst's career can therefore be handled with the utmost economy, and yet fill all the requirements of intelligent interest and comprehension. But, as a rule, the riddle novel approaches its theme in a spirit essentially other than that which inspires the short tale. We are given, as it were, a wide landscape instead of a detailed genre picture. The number of the dramatis personae is much larger, and the parts given to many of them may be very small, though each should have his or her necessary function in the general plan. It is much easier to create perplexity on these terms; but on the other hand, the riddle novel demands a power of vivid character portrayal and of telling description which are not indispensable in the briefer narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fault of all riddle novels is that they inevitably involve two kinds of interest, and can seldom balance these so perfectly that one or the other of them shall not suffer. The mind of the reader becomes weary in its frequent journeys between human characters on one side and the mysterious events on the other, and would prefer the more single-eyed treatment of the short tale. Wonder too is a very tender and short-lived emotion, and sometimes perishes after a few pages. Curiosity is tougher; but that, too, may be baffled too long, and end by tiring of the pursuit while it is yet in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many excellent plots, admirable from the constructive point of view, have been wasted by stringing them out too far; the reader recognizes their merit, but loses his enthusiasm on account of a sort of monotony of strain; he wickedly turns to the concluding chapter, and the game is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'The Woman in White,' by Wilkie Collins, was published about 1860, I think, in weekly installments, and certainly they were devoured with insatiable appetite by many thousands of readers. But I doubt whether a book of similar merit could command such a following to-day; and I will even confess that I have myself never read the concluding parts, and do not know to this day who the woman was or what were the wrongs from which she so poignantly suffered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories which ought to be shorter are sometimes made into novels by long and often tedious interpolations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; one of Conan Doyle's best stories, is unduly spun out by an interpolation which lasts from page 110 to 184. Likewise Gaboriau's &quot;The Mystery of Orcival&quot; has an interpolation from page 104 to 188. These extraneous narratives usually go back and tell of an episode that happened years before the scene of the story, and they are both uninteresting and inartistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, an author of detective fiction writes either short- stories or novels, but rarely both. Conan Doyle's only mystery novel is &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles;&quot; while Gaboriau and Anna Katharine Green invariably write novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we conclude that length is a matter of taste, and the detective fiction writer may use his own judgment as to the length of his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-narrator-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Narrator in the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teller of the Detective Story is an important factor in its technique. Many a good plot is spoiled because it is narrated by the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, with his quick sense of fitness, chose the narrator best calculated for the exploitation of his clever Dupin. This was a stroke of real genius, for the reader becomes acquainted with the principal through the subordinate. He is taught to look upon the work of a detective intelligently; taught to appreciate and understand it. He knows when it is time to applaud, because the narrator tells him. It is a pity that this narrator is nameless, for as Mrs. Harris, with even less personality, is a household word, so his name would have been. It is this narrator who rouses our interest, tantalizes our impatience, and piques our curiosity, in harmony with his own halting almost unbelieving observance of the marvels revealed to him. He teaches us to be amazed at the proper time and then at the proper time he explains what so amazed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Watson, narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, is a parallel character, though in no sense an imitation or plagiarism. The conditions of the revelations to be made require just such a person to make them; and without a doubt, Sherlock Holmes would have had his Dr. Watson even if Dupin had never had his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the glory and honor cast upon the hero by this humble but adoring satellite, this means of narration has another decided advantage. Since the detective confides in his friend or not, as he chooses, the author can reveal or conceal facts as he chooses, and so mislead the reader at will. What the subordinate does not know he can not tell, and thus is the secret preserved. Again, the subordinate being but fallible, may surmise mistakenly. So then does the reader, and again the author's ends are served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the author prefers that the tale be told in the third person, but even so, the character of &quot;Harris&quot; is still usually in evidence. Often he is a reporter, for this gives him opportunity to go uninvited, yet free from the stigma of idle curiosity into the scenes of interest. A reporter eager for a &quot;scoop&quot; for his paper, sets a fine example of alert interest and close scrutiny for the reader to profit by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the foreword to &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; the hero detective picks out his reporter and tells him how useful he will be to him in his work. &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; has the reporter &quot;Hutchinson Hatch,&quot; while &quot;Rouletabille&quot; has a clever reporter named &quot;Sainclair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the story may be told directly from the mouth of the author. But the proportion of this manner of telling is not so large in Detective Story work as in other fiction; because there are secrets to be preserved. Not only the main secret of the mystery, but also the secrets of what the strange proceedings of the detective may mean. And if the author is telling the tale, it is manifestly difficult for him to preserve an ingenuous and veracious manner, though this may be done if the author maintains a certain aloofness and an arbitrary standard of what to tell and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau's stories are all told in the third person; so are DuBoisgobey's and many of Anna Katharine Green's. Gaston Leroux uses this form and so does Mr. Webster in &quot;The Whispering Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a conglomeration of forms. The narrator is changed to suit the needs of the author, and the book is made up of the stories of the diaries of several people interested; &quot;The Woman in White&quot; follows the same narrative method. &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; is also told by various people, and sometimes in diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not always effective in other fiction, the diary is a most useful form for Detective Stories. For secrets can be confided to a diary, and though thus revealed to the reader, they are not disclosed to the other characters in the book; which is frequently a necessary condition. While never used for the whole book, the diary form often appears on certain pages of the story. &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; and many of our best authors' works show more or less of the useful and often necessary diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever narrator is chosen, let the choice be made after careful consideration of the conditions of the story. If there is a great surprise which must be concealed until the end, the narrator must be kept in ignorance of it until the end. If the story hinges on the marvelous brain work of a transcendent detective, give him a Dr. Watson to expatiate on it and to be awed by it. If a scientific or other straightforward recital of procedure, it may be told by the author. These points can best be learned and understood by reading the works of the best authors and noting what kind of narrator they choose and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-setting&quot;&gt;The Setting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting of the story will of course depend on the plot; but, other things being equal, do not choose too low life for your scenes. The facts of a murder are in themselves sufficiently unattractive to make it unnecessary to add to the distastefulness of the story by unpleasant surroundings. Let the people in your story be at least fairly well to do, of at least moderately good position and of a decent education. Unless absolutely necessary to have it otherwise, let the house or the scene of the crime be attractive or interesting, and let even the subordinate characters be of refined and intelligent type. For one reader who enjoys tales of slum life there are a dozen who prefer ladies and gentlemen, if not lords and ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be argued that murders or other crimes do not occur in high life as frequently as among the lower classes. This point may be open to discussion; but it would make no difference what the decision might be. Detective Stories are not realistic, and if the author choose to have his murder committed in a community of gentle-folk, he is entirely at liberty to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the locality and social customs of the story must be those with which the author is familiar. A Detective Story depends so much on the logic and plausibility of its conditions, that a vague or uncertain touch on the practical or material details greatly mars the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see to it, then, that our setting and our atmosphere are free from mistake or anachronism. Economy of attention demands that we keep the reader's mind wholly intent on the solution of the problem; and this may not be done if we allow questionable or contradictory work on the minor interests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance of the detective is always of interest and each author in turn endeavors to make his marvelous-minded creature look as physically unlike other fiction detectives as possible. And especially does he aim to have him totally different in his effects from the popular conception of the conventional detective. In fact the average detective of fiction is always declared to look absolutely unlike the average detective of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-early-detective-portraits&quot;&gt;Some Early Detective Portraits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Dupin is not described physically, as Poe's marvelous economy of attention made him omit every possible bit of material extraneous to his actual story. But, beginning let us say, with Lecoq, all seem to be diametrically opposed to the conventional detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from &quot;The Crime of Orcival&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq, whom none of them had ever met before, in no wise resembled the conventional French detective. The latter is commonly depicted as a tall fellow, with heavy moustaches and &quot;imperial,&quot; wearing a military stock collar, a greasy silk hat, and a threadbare frock-coat buttoned up to the throat so as to conceal either the complete absence of linen or at all events the extreme dirtiness of a calico shirt. Such an individual will have immense feet incaged in heavy Wellingtons and will carry in his right hand a powerful sword-stick or bludgeon. Now M. Lecoq, as he appeared in the diningroom at Valfeuillu, had nothing whatever in common with this familiar type. It is true, however, that he can assume whatever air he pleases. Although his friends declare that he has features of his own which he retains at home when sitting by his own fire-side, with his slippers on, this is by no means certain. At all events, his mobile face lends itself to strange transformations, and he modifies his features according to his will just as the sculptor moulds his modelling clay. He changes everything, even the expression of his eyes. On this occasion M. Lecoq had assumed a handsome wig of lank hair, neither fair nor dark, but rather pretentiously parted on one side. Whiskers of the same vague colour puffed out with bad pomade, encircled his pallid face. His eyelids were very red; his eyes seemed weak and watery, and an open smile rested on his thick lips, which, in parting, disclosed a range of long yellow teeth. Timidity, self-sufficiency, and contentment were equally blended in the expression of his features. No one would ever have credited the possessor of such a head with even average intelligence. He looked the picture of some dull-minded, money-grubbing haberdasher, who after cheating his customers for thirty years, had retired on a large income. His coat was like all other coats, his trousers like all other trousers. A hair-chain, of the same colour as his whiskers, spanned his stomach, and a large silver watch could be seen bulging out of his left waistcoat pocket. While he spoke he fumbled with a horn box full of tiny square lozenges, and adorned on the cover with the portrait of a homely well- dressed woman, &quot;the dear defunct,11 no doubt. As the conversation proceeded, according as he was satisfied or disturbed, M. Lecoq munched one of these lozenges or gave the portrait a glance which was quite a poem in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this was Lecoq in disguise. But the natural man, though seldom seen, was also unlike the regulation French detective. At his very first appearance on Gaboriau's pages he is described thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… he was about twenty-five years old, with a pale face, red lips and an abundance of curly black hair, but with scarcely a sign of beard or mustache. He was short but well-made, and his whole manner denoted energy of extraordinary character. With the exception of his eyes, there was nothing very remarkable in his appearance, but these either shone brilliantly or else grew dull, according to the disposition of the moment. His nose, which was rather wide, possessed an amount of flexibility that was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is old Father Tabaret, except on close inspection, apparently possessed of detective insight. Here is his picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a large, heavily curtained bed, covered up almost to the nose, lay the oracle of the Rue de Jerusalem. It was almost impossible to believe that such great intelligence could exist in that figure, the face of which showed nothing but the appearance of the greatest stupidity; a retreating forehead, huge ears, a little snub nose, small eyes, and thick lips, made M. Tabaret look more like a half-witted citizen than the sagacious citizen that he was. It is true that when he was closely examined there was something in him resembling a sleuth-hound, the habits and instincts of which he possessed to such a great extent. In the street the impudent young urchins would shout after him, &quot;Oh! what a guy,&quot; but he laughed at all this, and even took a pleasure in putting on an extra appearance of folly and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidocq, though not declared to be uncommon in his appearance, is sufficiently so to give him the necessary prestige. We are told that &quot;he was a strong, well-built man with square shoulders and shambling gait. He had gray hair, a thick nose, blue eyes, a smooth face and a perpetual smile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Vidocq really lived, yet his &quot;Memoirs&quot; are believed to be largely fiction, and so we may class him, in part at least, among our story-book friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins deliberately draws his picture of the official detective thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a family in our situation, the Superintendent of the Frizinghall police was the most comforting officer you could wish to see. Mr. Seegrave was tall and portly, and military in his manners. He had a fine, commanding voice, and a mighty resolute eye, and a grand frock coat which buttoned beautifully up to his leather stock. &quot;I'm the man you want,11 was written all over his face; and he ordered his two inferior policemen about with a severity which convinced us all that there was no trifling with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in every respect a vivid contrast, he gives us a picture of the engaging Sergeant Cuff, for after all, the beauty of a detective is largely in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the time came for the Sergeant's arrival I went down to the gate to look out for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A fly from the railway drove up as I reached the lodge; and out got a grizzled, elderly man, so miserably lean that he looked as if he had not got an ounce of flesh on his bones in any part of him. He was dressed all in decent black, with a white cravat round his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His face was as sharp as a hatchet, and the skin of it was as yellow and dry and withered as an autumn leaf. His eyes, of a steely light gray, had a disconcerting trick, when they encountered your eyes, of looking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself. His walk was soft; his voice was melancholy; his long, lanky fingers were hooked like claws. He might have been a parson, or an undertaker, or anything else you like, except what he really was. A more complete opposite to Superintendent Seegrave than Sergeant Cuff, and a less comforting officer to look at for a family in distress, I defy you to discover, search where you may.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-more-modern-portraits&quot;&gt;Some More Modern Portraits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes is too well known to the reading public to require description here, but a brief account of his appearance, as detailed by Watson, proves his unlikeness to those we have previously looked at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so exceedingly lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost ludicrous contrast to Holmes is a young detective who never achieved Sherlock's popularity, but whose wonderful instinct for pure reasoning puts him at the head of his own class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Rouletabille, who figures in &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His friend Sainclair, who is his Watsonian chronicler, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a &quot;permit to communicate&quot; for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, &quot;a good nut.&quot; He seemed to have taken his head—round as a bullet—out of a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of the press—all determined billiard-players—had given him that nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How, while still so young—he was only sixteen and a half years old when I saw him for the first time—had he already won his way on the press? That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked, if they had not known his history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, however, Rouletabille was not nominally the great detective of the book—that honor was given to Frederick Larsan—who seemed to show a few of Sherlock Holmes' physical characteristics. This is Larsan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair turning grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead was prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round, with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was of middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and gentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself. The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been taught by experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His strange profession had brought him into contact with so many crimes and villainies that it would have been remarkable if his nature had not been a little hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An interesting-looking detective is &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; of Jacques Futrelle. His description is written with Mr. Futrelle's individual touch, and Professor Van Dusen possesses the squint which Mr. Train regards as a detective's birthright:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Practically all those letters remaining in the alphabet after Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen was named, were afterward acquired by that gentleman in the course of a brilliant scientific career, and, being honorably acquired, were tacked on to the other end. His name, therefore, taken with all that belonged to it, was a wonderfully imposing structure. He was a Ph.D., an LL.D., an F.R.S. an M.D., and an M.D.S. He was also some other things—just what, he himself couldn't say—through recognition of his ability by various foreign educational and scientific institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In appearance he was no less striking than in nomenclature. He was slender, with the droop of the student in his thin shoulders and the pallor of a close, sedentary life on his clean-shaven face. His eyes wore a perpetual, forbidding squint—the squint of a man who studies little things—and when they could be seen at all through his thick spectacles, were mere slits of watery blue. But above his eyes was his most striking feature. This was a tall, broad brow, almost abnormal in height and width, crowned by a heavy shock of bushy, yellow hair. All these things conspired to give him a peculiar, almost grotesque personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is one of the very best constructors of a detective story. The first introduction of her Mr. Gryce begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And here let me say that Mr. Gryce, the detective, was not the thin, wiry individual with the piercing eye you are doubtless expecting to see. On the contrary, Mr. Gryce was a portly, comfortable personage with an eye that never pierced, that did not even rest on you. If it rested anywhere, it was always on some insignificant object in the vicinity, some vase, inkstand, book, or button. These things he would seem to take into his confidence, make the repositories of his conclusions; but as for you—you might as well be the steeple on Trinity Church, for all connection you ever appeared to have with him or his thoughts. At present, then, Mr. Gryce was, as I have already suggested, on intimate terms with the doorknob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a later book she again insists upon this unlikeness to what may be expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was therefore moving reluctantly away, when I felt a slight but peremptory touch on the arm, and turning, saw the detective a my side, still studying his piece of china.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was, as I have said, of portly build and benevolent aspect; a fatherly-looking man, and not at all the person one would be likely to associate with the police. Yet he could take the lead very naturally, and when he spoke, I felt bound to answer him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grodman, in &quot;Big Bow Mystery,&quot; is briefly described by Mr. Zangwill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After an age seven minutes by any honest clock—Grodman made his appearance, looking as dressed as usual, but with unkempt hair and with disconsolate side- whisker yet, for it had only recently come within the margin of cultivation. In active service Grodman had been clean-shaven, like all members of the profession—for surely your detective is the most versatile of actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the picture of Wimp the official detective in the same book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wimp was young and fresh-colored. He had a Roman nose, and was smartly dressed. He had beaten Grodman by discovering the wife Heaven meant for him. He had a bouncing boy, who stole jam out of the pantry without any one being the wiser. Wimp did what work he could do at home in a secluded study at the top of the house. Outside his chamber of horrors he was the ordinary husband of commerce. He adored his wife, who thought poorly of his intellect, but highly of his heart. In domestic difficulties Wimp was helpless. He could not even tell whether the servant's &quot;character&quot; was forged or genuine. Probably he could not level himself to such petty problems. He was like the senior wrangler who has forgotten how to do quadratics, and has to solve equations of the second degree by the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference to Wimp's wife is thus explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a moment the first floor window was raised—the little house was of the same pattern as her own—and Grodman's full, fleshy face loomed through the fog in sleepy irritation from under a nightcap. Despite its scowl the detective's face dawned upon her like the sun upon an occupant of the haunted chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What in the devil's the matter?&quot; he growled. Grodman was not an early bird, now that he had no worms to catch. He could afford to despise proverbs now, for the house in which he lived was his, and he lived in it because several other houses in the street were also his and it is well for the landlord to be about his own estate in Bow where poachers often shoot the moon. Perhaps the desire to enjoy his greatness among his early cronies counted for something, too, for he had been born and bred at Bow, receiving when a youth his first engagement from the local police quarters, whence he drew a few shillings a week as an amateur detective in his leisure hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grodman was still a bachelor. In the celestial matrimonial bureau a partner might have been selected for him, but he had never been able to discover her. It was his one failure as a detective. He was a self-sufficing person, who preferred a gas stove to a domestic; but in deference to Glover Street opinion he admitted a female factotum between ten a.m. and ten p.m., and, equally in deference to Glover Street opinion, excluded her between ten p.m. and ten a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-less-known-portraits&quot;&gt;Some Less Known Portraits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon Holmes inclines to Wilkie Collins' plan of contrasting the appearance of the real detective and the fictional at once. In &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance&quot; he presents these opposite physical effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inspector White, of Scotland Yard, was announced, and a short, thick-set man entered. He was absolutely round in every part. His sturdy, rotund frame was supported on stout, well-moulded legs. His bullet head, with close- cropped hair, gave a suggestion of strength to his rounded face, and a pair of small bright eyes looked suspiciously on the world from beneath well-arched eyebrows. Two personalities more dissimilar than those of Claude Bruce and Inspector White could hardly be brought together in the same room. People who are fond of tracing resemblances to animals in human beings would liken the one to a gray-hound, the other to a bull-dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet they were both masters in the art of detecting crime—the barrister subtle, analytic, introspective; the policeman direct, pertinacious, self-confident. Bruce lost all interest in a case when the hidden trail was laid bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. White regarded investigation as so many hours on duty until his man was transported or hanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; an astonishing detective story by Henry Kitchell Webster, we have this description of the detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was the sort of a man who never would be spoken of as old, if it were not for his attempts to look young. He was actually, I should judge, somewhere in the middle forties, a tall, graceful, and commanding figure, with a strikingly handsome face. There was nothing weak about it. The features were big and boldly, though finely, modeled, and the deep-set eyes singularly expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only fault one could find with him was that he carried everything just a little too far. He was too aggressively well dressed; too painfully clean-shaven; his manner a little too dignified; his voice and features a little too expressive. It came upon me all at once what he must be—an actor. That was it. Everything about him was heightened just enough to carry itself over the footlights. He was in evening dress, wore an overcoat and gloves, and carried a walking stick, as well as an irreproachable silk hat, in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Scales of Justice,&quot; an exceptionally clever surprise story by George L. Knapp, the Hero Detective is not a professional one, but a young newspaper reporter. He is therefore allowed the characteristics of our best newspaper men, but in all probability he inherits his sardonic humor from his predecessor Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kern tossed the shears into a drawer, and stood up. He was as tall as the other man, and as straight; and both had that alert look of expectancy, quite unmixed with either wonder or nervousness, which marks our best newspaper men. There the resemblance ended. Jennings was about thirty-five, smooth-shaven, smiling brown of hair and blue of eye; with humorous little wrinkles around the eyes to testify of the many funny things he had seen. Kern was twenty-eight or twenty-nine; and his coal-black hair and bronze-black Vandyke beard made him look more like an Austrian surgeon than an American reporter. His humor was apt to be sardonic; and a certain element of moodiness was seldom absent from his face. &quot;Kern is really a secret sufferer from the artistic temperament,&quot; said the managing editor once, &quot;but so long as he's trying to live it down, I won't give him away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Average Jones,&quot; the creation of Samuel Hopkins Adams, achieves a distinction by being inconspicuous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was, so to speak, a composite photograph of any thousand well-conditioned, clean living Americans between the ages of twenty-five and thirty. Happily, his otherwise commonplace face was relieved by the one unfailing characteristic of composite photographs, large, deep-set and thoughtful eyes. Otherwise he would have passed in any crowd, and nobody would have noticed him pass. Now, at twenty-seven, he looked back over the five years since his graduation from college and wondered what he had done with them; and at the four previous years of undergraduate life and wondered how he had done so well with those, and why he had not in some manner justified the parting words of his favorite professor: &quot;You have one rare faculty, Jones. You can, when you choose, sharpen the pencil of your mind to a very fine point. Specialize, my boy, specialize.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little like &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; is &quot;The Man in the Comer,&quot; described thus by the Baroness Orczy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultramorose fancy. Polly thought to herself that she had never seen anyone so pale, so thin, with such funny light-coloured hair, brushed very smoothly across the top of a very dubiously bald crown. He looked so timid and nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string; his long, lean, and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful and complicated proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astro, the hero of Gelett Burgess's book of Mystery Stories, is perhaps the farthest possible remove from a conventional detective in appearance. Though not described categorically, we are given various word pictures of him in his &quot;psychic studio.&quot; There he lounges among oriental divans and draperies, wearing a jewelled turban, flowing silken robes, and other characteristic apparel, as he indulges in the enjoyment of his silver-mounted water-pipe or his pet white lizard. He has sufficiently unusual eccentricities to put him in the list of correctly made up fiction detectives, and though blase, he is original and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idiosyncrasies-of-fictional-detectives&quot;&gt;Idiosyncrasies of Fictional Detectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fictional detectives have peculiar and individual tricks of personality which are doubtless intended for the reader to remember them by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dupin had the most pronouncedly queer traits of all. Perhaps none of his successors ever achieved anything so freakish as this described below; and which, had he lived to-day, would have given him a claim to the title of &quot;Sun Dodger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamoured of the night for her own sake, and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighted a couple of tapers, which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm and arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes' idiosyncrasies are too well known to need recapitulation. His morphine habit, his musical taste and his sardonic moods are familiar to all. Holmes also had a habit of listening to his clients' recitals with his eyes shut. Though to be sure this was less radical than the proceeding of Dupin who &quot;sat in his accustomed armchair, the embodiment of respectful attention&quot; but he wore green spectacles which allowed him to &quot;sleep not the less soundly, though silently&quot; throughout the long account of the case by the Prefect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holmes' odd habits are here referred to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and- tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humors would sit in an arm-chair with his hair- trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are, we must admit, unusual habits, but still Dr. Watson assures us that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Dr. Watson's suspicions were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq's eccentricity was his habit of silent communion with a portrait of his wife which he carried with him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq had recourse to the portrait on the lozenge- box. His look was more than a glance, it was a confidence. He was evidently saying something to the dear defunct, which he dared not utter aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This habit is also noted in Mr. Gryce. This delightful old gentleman had a way of addressing himself to any small inanimate object in his neighborhood. It might be an inkstand or a doorknob, but he treated it, to all appearance, as his guide, philosopher and friend. On one occasion he became very chummy with a statue at the foot of a staircase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whereupon I repeated my words, this time very quietly but clearly, while Mr. Gryce continued to frown at the bronze figure he had taken into his confidence. When I had finished, Mr. Van Burnam's countenance had changed, so had his manner. He held himself as erect as before, but not with as much bravado. He showed haste and impatience also, but not the same kind of haste and not quite the same kind of impatience. The corners of Mr. Gryce's mouth betrayed that he noted this change, but he did not turn away from the newel-post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, upon occasion, Mr. Gryce is unable to take active interest in the evidence being deposed by a witness because of his intense absorption in a &quot;close and confidential confab with his own finger-tips.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Cuff, however, has a very sane and pleasant fad of his own, but he puts it to its proper use when he employs it to evade impertinent or unwelcome queries. Instead of dashing madly into his &quot;investigations&quot; the celebrated detective goes off on a side track thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, you've got the right exposure here to the south and sou'west,&quot; says the Sergeant, with a wag of his grizzled head, and a streak of pleasure in his melancholy voice. &quot;This is the shape for a rosery—nothing like a circle set in a square. Yes, yes; with walks between all the beds. But they oughtn't to be gravel-walks like these. Grass, Mr. Gardener—grass-walks between your roses; gravel's too hard for them. That's a sweet pretty bed of white roses and blush roses. They always mix well together, don't they? Here's the white musk-rose, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Betteredge—our old English rose holding up his head along with the best and newest of them. Pretty dear!&quot; says the Sergeant, fondling the musk-rose with his lanky fingers, and speaking to it as if he were speaking to a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a nice sort of a man to recover Miss Rachel's Diamond, and to find out the thief who stole it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You seem to be fond of roses. Sergeant?&quot; I remarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven't much time to be fond of anything,&quot; says Sergeant Cuff. &quot;But, when I have a moment's fondness to bestow, most times, Mr. Betteredge, the roses get it. I began my life among them in my father's nursery garden, and I shall end my life among them if I can. Yes. One of these days (please God) I shall retire from catching thieves, and try my hand at growing roses. There will be grass-walks, Mr. Gardener, between my beds,&quot; says the Sergeant, on whose mind the gravel-paths of a rosery seemed to dwell unpleasantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It seems an odd taste, sir,&quot; I ventured to say, &quot;for a man in your line of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If you will look about you (which most people won't do),&quot; says Sergeant Cuff, &quot;you will see that the nature of a man's tastes is, most times, as opposite as possible to the nature of a man's business. Show me any two things more opposite one from the other than a rose and a thief, and I'll correct my tastes accordingly—if it isn't too late at my time of life. You find the damask-rose a good- ish stock for most of the tender sorts, don't you, Mr. Gardener? Ah! I thought so. Here's a lady coming. Is it Lady Verinder?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiarity of &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; and what gives him his title, is a curious vocal defect which at times prevents his audible speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;favorite-phrases-of-detectives&quot;&gt;Favorite Phrases of Detectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Thinking Machine,&quot; aside from his petulance and impatience, continually repeats two or three favorite phrases that annoy the reader quite as much as the clients annoy this astute detective. One of them is, &quot;Don't say it is impossible! that annoys me exceedingly! Nothing is impossible to the human mind!&quot; This assertion, innocent enough in itself, is so frequently repeated as to become intolerable. Another phrase of which Professor Van Dusen is inordinately fond, is, &quot;Two and two make four, not sometimes, but all the time.&quot; This also is repeated so often as to become tiresome. To quote the Professor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Two and two make four, not sometimes, but all the time,&quot; he began, at last as if disputing some previous assertion. &quot;As the figure two, wholly disconnected from any other, gives small indication of a result, so is an isolated fact of little consequence. Yet that fact added to another, and the resulting fact added to a third, and so on, will give a final result. That result, if every fact is considered must be correct. Thus any problem may be solved by logic; logic is inevitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, variations on a theme of two and two making four are hackneyed in detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a figure of speech, the proposition that two and two make four except in unusual cases, is fair enough. It is paraphrased thus: in &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can't s'y as I know anythink about it, sir, but by puttin' two and two together it makes four sometimes—not always.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite right. You're a philosopher. Let me hear the two two's. We'll see about the addition afterwards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is humorously referred to in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; by Mary Roberts Rinehart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point in my story, Halsey always says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Trust a woman to add two and two together, and make six&quot; To which I retort that if two and two plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world. That a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same proposition is quoted as the keynote of a detective's method in &quot;The Holladay Case&quot; where, in praise of the detective, it is remarked, &quot;Your work convinced us that you know how to put two and two together, which is more than can be said for the ordinary mortal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &quot;The House Opposite&quot; the detective declares that to succeed in his profession requires, &quot;accurate and most minute powers of observation, unlimited patience, and a capacity for putting two and two together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes shows a grasp of the principle, when he says, &quot;If you were asked to prove that two and two make four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe disdained the simple reference to two plus two, but embodied a similar idea in this subtle manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that X squared plus px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where X squared plus px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspiring author, then, will do well to omit further references to the adding of two and two as an illuminating point in his story. Eccentricities or freakish habits on the part of his detective are permissible if not harped upon too continuously. But let them be of a pleasant or at least of an unobjectionable nature, and not like a habit attributed to a detective in a series of stories now current, who pulled at the lobe of his ear, until a fastidious reader was fain to close the book in disgust. Let the habits of your hero be whimsical, mysterious, or erratic, if you choose; but let them be agreeable and not too frequently reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plot-is-the-story&quot;&gt;The Plot is the Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the detective story, short or long, has but one plot—the problem and its solution. No matter what elaboration may be introduced, the skeleton of the plot is the same; and it is this simplicity of construction, this straight and narrow path of procedure, that makes the writing of detective stories both easy and hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bliss Perry eliminates the necessity in some stories, and by some writers for any characterization or setting whatever. He says, in &quot;A Study of Prose Fiction:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If its plot be sufficiently entertaining, comical, novel, thrilling, the characters may be the merest lay figures and yet the story remains an admirable work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poe's tales of ratiocination, as he loved to call them, like &quot;The Gold Bug,&quot; &quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; or his tales of pseudo-science, like &quot;A Descent into the Maelstrom,&quot; are dependent for none of their power upon any interest attaching to character. The exercise of the pure logical faculty, or the wonder and the terror of the natural world, gives scope enough for that consummate craftsman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in his &quot;Talks on Writing English&quot; Arlo Bates observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a crude popular idea that the refinements of literary art are wasted, at any rate upon the general reader. So many books succeed, at least temporarily, which can make no slightest pretence to any grace of manner, and which have not even the merit of reasonable accuracy, that the student is apt to feel that these things are superfluous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have shown earlier in the book that while a detective story, even if poorly written, may interest and amuse, it is not literature unless it shows that superiority of intellectual attainment demanded by the critics or scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructing the Plot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But referring now to the plot, let the young writer be careful that he plans his story with absolute logic and sequence. Poe tells us that it was his &quot;design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referable either to accident or intuition; that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accept Poe as the master in this field of fiction, and we can do no better than to study both his own stories and his essays in criticism of them. He makes this definite statement regarding the plotting of a story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing is more clear than that every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its denouement before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the denouement constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building a story, then, let us construct it entirely from start to finish before beginning its actual diction. Construct the plot backward, if need be; but see to it that every incident and every episode, every speech of the characters and every hint of the author have their direct bearing on the statement of the problem or the quest of its solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another valuable point in construction given us by Poe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The design of mystery, however, being once determined upon by an author, it becomes imperative, first that no undue or inartistical means be employed to conceal the secret of the plot; and, secondly, that the secret be well kept. Now, when, at page 16, we read that &quot;the body of poor Mr. Rudge, the steward, was found&quot; months after the outrage, etc., we see that Mr. Dickens has been guilty of no misdemeanor against art in stating what was not the fact; since the falsehood is put into the mouth of Solomon Daisy, and given merely as the impression of thus individual and of the public. The writer has not asserted it in his own person, but ingeniously conveyed an idea (false in itself, yet a belief in which is necessary for the effect of the tale) by the mouth of one of his characters. The case is different, however, when Mrs. Rudge is repeatedly denominated &quot;the widow.&quot; It is the author who, himself, frequently so terms her. This is disingenuous and inartistical; accidentally so, of course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exactly parallel idea to this may be noticed in &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; Harwell, the private secretary, is a witness at the inquest. Also, he is the murderer. In the very beginning of the book the question is put to him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are the person who last saw Mr. Leavenworth alive, are you not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are then told that the young man raised his head with a haughty gesture that well nigh transfigured it, and replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Certainly not; as I am not the man who killed him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, he was the man who killed him, and had the author told the reader he was not, it would have been infringing on the rights of the reader. But it is perfectly legitimate that the character in the book should make this false statement, by way of not incriminating himself. By this device the reader is not only convinced that this Harwell is innocent, but feels a warming sympathy toward the suspected man. Harwell's status now being established in the reader's mind, as that of injured innocence, he is at liberty to figure prominently all through the book, yet never arouse the reader's sleeping suspicion until the author so wills it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is a strong one to a conscientious writer of detective fiction—to learn at the end of the volume that the real culprit is the person who has been before you throughout, but whom you never have dreamed of suspecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is an adept in the use of this plan, and surpasses most other writers in her ability to carry her unsuspected criminal straight through the book to the last page. In reading &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; who would guess that Lawyer Orcutt was the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens? The thrilling story goes on, and the reader successively suspects Hildreth, Mansell, or any character in the book rather than Orcutt, the grave and aristocratic lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this surprise, when at last the identity of the criminal is learned, that is the crux of the Detective Story. Observation and deduction, though important in interest, are side issues of the plot—which must bend all else to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; who would guess or even deduce that the clever detective is himself the criminal? Note how deftly he is introduced to the reader, because &quot;he is destined to play a large and most romantic part in the solution of the mystery, and his queer, brilliant, eccentric personality is to appear very often in the ensuing pages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this hint gives the reader no suspicion that the man thus introduced is really the criminal, nor does he suspect it until the very last. This book is rather more subtly constructed than &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; in that the motive for the crime is shown in the beginning of the book; though so skilfully veiled that even an experienced reader might be excused for not discerning it. The author, Henry Kitchell Webster, calls this his favorite of all the books he has written. He says, and very truly, that &quot;he has played fair with his readers, given them every bit of information-all the clues to the identity of the person who committed the crime—that he himself has, but managing to lead their attention away from the real culprit until the desired moment for climax and revelation has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In this kind of story when the big smash comes the reader should be able to go back in the story, and having reread all that goes up to the climax be able to unravel each clue which leads to the climax.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the true spirit of the writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintaining-suspense&quot;&gt;Maintaining Suspense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another and very necessary point to remember is that the mystery must be of sufficient interest to be worth unraveling. To quote Anna Katharine Green on her methods of construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I must have a central idea which appeals to my imagination; and an end of such point or interest that the reader will feel that it justifies the intricacies which are introduced to hold it back. In other words the heart of the labyrinth must be worth reaching.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course refers especially to books, where more intricacies must be introduced than in a short-story. Mr. Burton E. Stevenson, a successful writer of detective fiction, professes these principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;First, to play fair with the reader, the cards must all lie on the table. It isn't honest to keep any up your sleeve; and the problem is to surprise the reader by the unexpected way in which you combine them. The reader must have before him all the facts which the solver of the mystery has, and then the 'Solver' must get there first. I also refuse to make any person act suspiciously without cause. If the person is innocent there is no reason why he should behave as though he were guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I think perhaps my particular trick is to keep the reader in suspense not so much as to what is going to happen as to how it is going to happen. I may add that it also seems necessary to me that every mystery should be approached from at least two angles; say, an amateur detective and a professional one, for instance; and that a great part of the interest of the story lies in the conflict between them, victory leaning first toward one and then toward the other. When I start a story I write it clear through, working regularly every day, (though it takes the lash sometimes) and then going back to do the dovetailing. There must be no loose ends; every joint must fit and there must be no superfluous lumber. A detective story ought to run a swift, straight course from start to finish. It isn't a leisurely stroll through the country, it's a hundred yard dash! And you may have noted that in &quot;The Boule Cabinet&quot; there isn't a hint of love interest; love interest is dead weight unless it is an essential part of the plot; and one can't carry much dead weight and win a hundred yard dash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stevenson succinctly expresses the true principles of detective fiction; and by adhering to these, the young writer is travelling in the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nevil Monroe Hopkins—whose detective, &quot;Mason Brant,&quot; operates in &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. North,&quot; and other novelettes—writes thus on the same subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I endeavor to start right off with action and to maintain it throughout, introducing such interesting characters and atmosphere as I can. I try to have a novel plot and to make most of the characters talk to each other in a direct manner; and to have some of the meeting-places, at least, rather gruesome. I endeavor also to have a golden thread of love and romance running from start to finish, upon which to string the more unwholesome elements which are necessary to contribute effectively to the phases of mystery. I believe always in writing deductively, in visiting queer places, and in accumulating acquaintances among police officials, doctors, lawyers, coroners, and the like.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see that the advisability of romance in detective stories is a matter of opinion, and opinions differ among the authorities. But the love interest, if not overdone, may be left to the discretion of the author, remembering that the mystery is the primary interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-the-story&quot;&gt;Planning the Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Kitchell Webster gives perhaps a more definite formula than those above quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BEFORE WRITING: 1. Plan original crime, method, and motive of the murderer. 2. Create, with this as a nucleus, sub-plots relating to several persons who by coincidence are drawn to the place or are connected with the victim, in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;THEN WRITE. 1. Introduction. 2. Murder discovery. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then take up the least likely suspect first, followed by others. 4. Hero Detective enters, decides, arrests and explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gelett Burgess constructs his stories by architectural diagrams. The first story in his book, &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; (published anonymously) is &quot;The Missing John Hudson&quot;—We subjoin its preliminary plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Murder)
(A) d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C) d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Theft)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The Missing John Hudson&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a, b, c, d = Clues A, B, C, D = Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another well-known writer gives this very definite formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Preliminaries. Status quo. Introduction of dramatis personae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Birth of Plot. Assembly of actors and assignment of parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tentative separation of sheep from goats, intentionally misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Crime,—shot into the story like a bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gropings for murderer, on part of the police, coroner, friends, relatives and amateur detective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Failure of everybody. Call in Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He glances about, announces that the facts are thus and so and proves that the facts are thus and so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Discreet removal of the villain by suicide, accident or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marriage of the girl to the amateur detective. (This is invariable and imperative!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The last item is in satiric vein, for among our best writers it is not considered imperative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the foregoing formulae, kindly contributed by their authors, cannot fail to be of use to the beginning writer of Detective Stories. They all agree in the principal points, and are quite in line with Poe's strict laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rights of the reader must be kept in mind by the author. It is not fair to mislead the reader until he is up against a blank wall. A false clue must lead in an obvious and seemingly logical direction. Then the false clue must be detected, as a natural consequence of the mistaken lead, and the right clues brought into view. It is not fair to make an innocent character appear guilty or vice versa, but it is quite right if the character make himself appear so. A witness who stammers and hesitates, may be guilty or may be innocently embarrassed. That is for the reader to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just in proportion to the cleverness and subtlety of the author's inventive genius, will the reader be duly and rightfully bewildered, or misled, and the game be well played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Max Dessoir, in a very fine article on &quot;The Psychology of Conjuring,&quot; writes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;By awakening interest in some unimportant detail, the conjurer concentrates that attention on some false point, or negatively, diverts it from the main object, and we all know the senses of an inattentive person are pretty dull… When causing the disappearance of some object, the conjurer counts one, two, three, because, the attention of the public being diverted to three, they do not notice what happens at one and two… A specially successful method of diversion is founded on the human craze for imitation… The conjurer counts on this in many cases. He always looks in the direction where he wants the attention of the public, and does everything himself which he wants the public to do… If the trick is in the left hand, the conjurer turns sharply to the person to the right, presuming correctly that the spectators will make the same movement, and will not notice what is going on in the left hand… Every sharp, short remark will, for a moment, at least, divert the eyes from the hands and direct them to the mouth, according to the above-mentioned law of imitation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These most valuable directions may be helpfully adapted to the writing of Detective Stories. The author is, in a way, a conjuror, with an avowed intent to hoodwink his audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Stories call for logic, plausibility and a true sense of proportion. Literary ability is to be desired; but before that, there must be power of deduction and a perfect sense of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-humor&quot;&gt;The Question of Humor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If romance is out of place in a detective story, humor is even more so. With the exception of the whimsical De Quincey and the waggish Zangwill, few can write or read about murder with any touch of humor. The best Detective Stories are absolutely void of it, and except in the hands of a whimsical genius it is entirely out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zangwill wrote only one Detective Story, but that one is unique; and in plot far and away cleverer than any tale of a Transcendent Detective. Though professing to care little for this Detective Story of his, he says in the preface to its second edition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Big Bow Mystery1 seems to me an excellent murder story, as murder stories go, for, while as sensational as the most of them, it contains more humor and character creation than the best. Indeed, the humor is too abundant. Mysteries should be sedate and sober. There should be a pervasive atmosphere of horror and awe such as Poe manages to create. Humor is out of tone; it would be more artistic to preserve a somber note throughout. But I was a realist in those days, and in real life mysteries occur to real persons with their individual humors, and mysterious circumstances are apt to be complicated by comic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-unique-devices&quot;&gt;Some Unique Devices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique plot in which the unsuspected criminal is ever before us is &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux. This astonishing story depends on two absolutely original propositions. One, that the attempt at murder in an inaccessible room occurred long before it was supposed to have done so. The other that the great and celebrated detective who condescends to take the case is really the criminal. But the workmanship of this story and the several and perfect surprises can only be appreciated by reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in all probability the great desire of the detective writer to choose for his criminal the character least likely to be suspected, that first suggested making the criminal of the story the detective also. Surely the last person the reader would suspect would be the detective. This has been frequently done of late, indeed so frequently as to cause great danger of this plot's losing its effectiveness. For the astute reader, always ready to learn the latest trick, has even now begun to suspect the least likely one for the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Accomplice,&quot; by F.T. Hill, the criminal is the prosecuting attorney, which is in itself a clever idea, and gives scope for beautifully misleading incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, then, marshal your characters tentatively and select the one seemingly impossible as a criminal. Give him a plausible and adequate motive. Give him opportunity. Give him intelligence and ability to hide his traces; and then go on, using every sidelight and every tiny clue possible, gently to persuade your reader, but never to force him, to a false conclusion; and then at the last spring your surprise suddenly and drop the curtain at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more annoying to the trained reader than a long chapter of explanation after the revelation. We have sometimes more than one chapter of the dead criminal's written confession, and our wonder and curiosity also being dead, we take little interest in the perusal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless this post-mortem confession is inevitable to your plot, so arrange it that the motives and methods are explained just before the climax instead of just after, Conan Doyle beautifully escaped this situation in &quot;A Study in Scarlet/' by reserving Sherlock Holmes' explanation of his own work until after the long and wearisome interpolation revealing the motive of the crime. The reader waded through, or skimmed through those chapters, because spurred on by his desire to learn the re-solution of the problem, to which he knew the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Conan Doyle is not at his best in mystery novels. The short-story is his forte. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; the author realizes often that the action must be retarded, and Sherlock Holmes for once in his life is obliged to bungle. About a third of the way through the book. Holmes indulges in a shrug and a rueful smile. &quot;Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,&quot; said he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in a short-story would he have made his third thread snap, nor would he, indeed, have had any third thread; the first would have led to the desired goal. But in a book, threads must be multiplied and snapped and tangled to make the larger web. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; we are treated to descriptions of scenery. We learn that &quot;Rolling pasture lands curved upwards on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit country-side there rose, ever dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.&quot; In a short-story these things would have been left to the imagination, for lack of room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that, in the book, unnecessary though acceptable characters had to be introduced, such as Selden and his wife's brother. A love interest is introduced around the beautiful Miss Stapleton. The device of Watson's diary report is introduced to delay the decisions of Sherlock Holmes. And the mysterious &quot;L.L.&quot; is invented for the same reason. But so accustomed is Conan Doyle to the quick action of a short-story that these forced delays hamper him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is, however, exceedingly clever in palming off his own desires for delay upon his characters; as for instance in the following detail of Holmes' character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of Sherlock Holmes's defects—if, indeed, one may call it a defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfillment. Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the real reason for Holmes' silence during that long, dark drive was because if he had told all he knew, the story would have ended then and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is characteristic of Conan Doyle, the denouement of this story entirely satisfies the reader. The exceedingly bizarre conception of this supernatural hound is logically and rationally explained. Moreover, and the young writer would do well to note this point, the criminal is summarily and inconspicuously disposed of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always unpleasant to contemplate the hanging or the electrocuting of the fiction criminal. For this reason he not infrequently takes poison (which he has ready in his pocket), as soon as he is discovered, and dies peacefully, close upon the last words of his confession. This is one of the conventions adopted to spare the reader's feelings. For a criminal that can hold the reader's interest throughout the story is often too attractive a character to be permitted a horrible taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these conventions and devices and unwritten laws of the technique of the Mystery Story can only be learned—or, at least, can best be learned—from the thoughtful reading of the works of the masters in this field. The beauty and value of these creations cannot be appreciated by the casual or untrained reader. Only a connoisseur in the art of detective fiction can appreciate and intelligently enjoy the skill with which a great author plays with his readers. It may be likened to the skilled fisherman playing with trout. Or perhaps it is better symbolized by these remarks of the Great Herrman when speaking of his handcuff tricks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Common sense alone does not entitle a person to judge competently of the safety of fetters; only the man who is familiar with the technique of knots and the different ways of tying can express an opinion. To decide whether a closure is right or not, requires technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most people imagine that they can go unprepared to a spiritualistic seance, and pass a correct opinion on the existence or nonexistence of prestidigitation. This standpoint is as childish as when a layman expresses himself on the genuineness of the seal of the middle ages or on the nature of a nervous affection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, the reader who is unversed in the arts and crafts of detective fiction cannot be expected to value the skill shown in the great presentations of The Problem and its Solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admitting that, according to a consensus of opinion, a murder mystery makes the most interesting plot for a Detective Story, let us consider the characters that necessarily belong to such a plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-victim&quot;&gt;The Victim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Quincey has pointed out, in his entertaining essay, that the victim of the crime should be selected with great care. Let us then, in planning our story, first decide upon the victim. Shall we choose a man or a woman—old or young?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite victim with the writers of Detective Fiction is an elderly man, perhaps a banker, or some other wealthy citizen of importance to the community. This is a reasonable choice, for the character has the regard and interest of his fellow townsmen, without too great sympathy on the part of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, a charming young woman may be chosen for this role, but in this case the reader must not be allowed to know and love her before the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point to be remembered by the author is that the victim must be of the greatest possible importance generally, yet not specifically in the sympathy of the reader. Indeed, the victim, if beautiful or worthy, must be almost or entirely a stranger to the reader. But if the victim be wicked or unattractive, it matters not how great the reader's acquaintance with him. In a word, the reader must be averse to or indifferent to the victim, in order that he-may be satisfied with the conditions of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly Poe reached the height of perfection in his choice, when he selected a mother and a daughter for the victims of the &quot;Rue Morgue.&quot; What could be more dramatic? And yet as the reader knew nothing and never learned anything of these two people except their names, casually named in a newspaper report, he could not feel a personal grief at their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accept the deceased gentleman of Doyle's &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; or the murdered bride of Green's &quot;The Filigree Ball&quot; or the brutally-assassinated &quot;Widow Lerouge&quot; by Ga- boriau, because they are all strangers to us, and we know they are a necessary part, indeed, the very foundation of the machinery of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guard against introducing the victim too long before the murder, or allowing him or her to engage too deeply the reader's sympathy or admiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not so likely to be the case in a short-story as in a novel. There are few, if any, of Conan Doyle's victims for whom we have any personal feeling whatever. Indeed, they are usually dead when the story begins, unless the problem may be a matter of preventing the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select your victim for his or her intrinsic worth or prominence and the sympathetic interest he or she may have for the other characters of the story, but not for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; and &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; these principles are strictly observed. In &quot;The Big Bow Mystery,&quot; the horrible deed is committed on a man we know nothing of, and one who is quite as much a lay figure as is a tailor's dummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; the victim is a beautiful young woman who has our entire sympathy and admiration, but the situation is saved because she is not really killed in the attempt at murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An occasional device is to have the victim apparently a good and kind old gentleman, most foully murdered. But later it transpires that the seemingly good and kind victim was in reality a very bad man, and was killed in justice and righteous indignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle as a rule makes his victim an inconspicuous and even uninteresting character—oftenest, perhaps, a bad old man. When, as in the case of &quot;The Speckled Band,&quot; the intended victim is a young woman, the tragedy is whisked around and the villain proves to be the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is entirely legitimate and advisable. The ideal victim is one in whom we have no personal interest, but whose importance we easily recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-criminal&quot;&gt;The Criminal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next character to be chosen must be our criminal. Here again is one, who, if he is to be convicted, must not be too deeply in the reader's sympathy. And yet he must be a worthwhile character; it is old-fashioned, now, to have the crime committed by the butler or the private secretary. The drawing of the criminal calls for fine shading and strong effects. He must be both intelligent and ingenious, in order to give the Transcendent Detective a foeman worthy of his steel. The reader must have no liking or pity for him. In his perfection he should be what Poe calls, &quot;that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, he must be cleverly drawn in order to conceal his identity from the reader until the last. He must appear to be what he is not, and he must not appear to be what he is; and this calls for Machiavelian cunning on the part of both criminal and author. The identity of the criminal, disclosed at the last, must be the greatest surprise of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is marvellously well accomplished in &quot;Hand and Ring&quot; and &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot; In both these books the reader cannot possibly guess the criminal, although he is inconspicuously in plain view from the very beginning. But so adroitly is his identity concealed and so definitely is he made to appear what he is not, that detection by the reader is not possible. To be sure, in neither book is the motive so much as hinted at until the final disclosures, and this is not quite in accordance with the unwritten law of the Detective Story. But it is forgivable in the books mentioned, because of their splendid workmanship and original plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Leavenworth Case,&quot; written many years ago, we have one of the earliest and best examples of the private secretary criminal. Here, too, he is before our eyes from the very beginning, yet we suspect everyone else in the book before we think of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faulty-portrayal-of-the-criminal&quot;&gt;Faulty Portrayal of the Criminal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau was at fault in this matter in the &quot;Widow Lerouge.&quot; By the time we are half through the book and long before any hint of the true state of affairs is necessary, we are forced to the inevitable conclusion of the guilt of Noel, start ling as that theory seems on its face, simply because Noel is the only possible person who has consistently avoided being the object of suspicion. A still greater mistake is when during the course of a story every character is at some time suspected and then cleared of suspicion, and at the end we learn that the crime is committed by a person of whom we have never heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle employs this hitherto unknown criminal frequently. Usually he is some old man who had known and quarreled with his old friend, the victim, many years before. For instance, in &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot; and in &quot;The Five Orange Pips,&quot; these are the circumstances. But Conan Doyle's motive is the exploitation of the powers of his Transcendent Detective in discovering the unheard-of criminal, and so in his case the end justified the means. But ordinarily, and especially in a book, it is bad workmanship to absent the criminal from the scene until the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the criminal of the Rue Morgue murders, it is ill-advised to have a freakish or a superhuman agency. The imitators of Poe's masterpiece have not been successful, though many have impressed members of the Simian tribe into their service as criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal criminal is a sane, respectable and well-educated man, like Lawyer Orcutt, or Mr. Grodman. Such as these escape the reader's suspicion by seeming to belong among the reputable characters of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-secondary-detective&quot;&gt;The Secondary Detective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Transcendent Detective being of such importance as to require a chapter to himself, we come next to the sub ordinate detective. He is usually a Central Office Man, or a young reporter, or a lawyer with a taste for detective work. He serves as a foil for the higher detective's glories. He makes mistakes for the other to correct. He starts false trails to lead the reader astray and to give the superior detective opportunity to scoff at him and to set him right. This character may not be a detective at all, but simply a &quot;Greek Chorus,&quot; like Dr. Watson, or like Hutchinson Hatch in &quot;The Thinking Machine,&quot; or Walter Jameson in the &quot;Silent Bullet.&quot; But usually this character is a detective who variously hinders or assists, as Sweetwater with Mr. Gryce, or Mr. Barnes with Mr. Mitchel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This secondary detective character is, at times and quite effectively, a woman. In &quot;That Affair Next Door&quot; this role is taken by Miss Amelia Butterworth, who is also the teller of the story. In &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; Astro is aided and abetted in his charlatanry by a beautiful young woman called Valeska. In a clever series of stories called &quot;Tales from the Red Ledger,&quot; the Transcendent Detective is helped at times by a mysterious and vaguely-pictured woman known as &quot;The Orchid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But invariably it is a good device to have a major and a minor detective character, that by comparison or contrast their leads and misleads may further the author's ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspects are highly important characters in our Detective Story. They appear one after another, few or many, according to the length of the story. As each suspect is brought forward, the reader must be made to feel certain that this is the criminal. Then a doubt is raised or positive innocence is shown, and the next suspect is brought forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a tale of simple construction, the suspects will come forward, a, b, c, d. The first three are eventually proved innocent and D is the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more complex plot would have D wrongly accused and proved innocent and show that, after all, C was the criminal. In this case the reader must be made to insist to himself that he knew it was C all the time, even though the case looked pretty black against D. Or, a clever dodge is to suspect the characters in order, and though A was exonerated long ago, prove at the last that he was the real criminal after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the variations of these plans that make for interest in a Detective Story, and the characterization of these suspects has much to do with the success of the plot. The breathless fear that the criminal may be the beautiful but headstrong young woman; the ever rising suspicion that the criminal is the handsome, manly hero; the lurking doubt of the nephew who inherits; the distrust of certain old family servants all these serve to keep interest alive and curiosity piqued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal characteristics, then, of our criminal must be his own importance, his dramatic personality, and his successful concealment until the denouement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules are not inflexible for short-stories, where there is less room for characterization than in books. The criminals in Conan Doyle's stories, like the victims, have little personality, because the fierce light that beats upon Sherlock Holmes leaves most of the other characters in shadow. But in a full- sized novel, where characterization is an important factor of the workmanship, the criminal's make-up is of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-heroine-and-the-element-of-romance&quot;&gt;The Heroine and the Element of Romance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the advisability of a heroine, authorities differ. The true economy of the Detective Story forbids the introduction of romance, especially in short-stories. The purists hold that the single-minded artist in detective fiction must not introduce two kinds of interest, for they can seldom be so perfectly balanced that one or the other shall not surer. The mind of the reader does not wish to jump continually from the solution of the problem to a love interest, and back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some writers deem it necessary to introduce a charming young woman who has little to do with the story, and who invariably marries the subordinate detective. The truth is, the magazine editors are largely to blame for this use of romance. In their inexorable demand for &quot;a happy ending,&quot; they insist upon those wedding bells at the end of the story, that their joyful peals may drown the sound of the sentence pronounced on the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Poe and Conan Doyle and all their worth-while successors omit the element of romance, except where it is an inherent part of the plot. Otherwise, romance in a Detective Story is wasteful and ridiculous excess. The whole intent of the problem and its solution is to engage the attention of the reader to the very utmost, and if this be successfully done, the reader has no nook or comer of his attention vacant to accommodate this love interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if, as in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia,&quot; the beautiful woman is an integral part of the story, then she may be introducer and expatiated upon at the pleasure of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story just referred to, this point is marvelously well taken in these opening words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer-excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intuitions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high- power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though expressing it strongly, it is true that extraneous romance in a Detective Story is like grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in a high-power lens. But, of course, in a novel or even a novelette the case is altered. Here we require a setting of picturesque complexity. And a love interest, properly managed, and woven into the mystery plot is almost a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the introduction of the feminine element in a Detective Story is subject to certain and definite rules. A victim she may be, a suspect she may be, but only in rare cases and when exceptionally well done, should she be the criminal. As a suspect, a feminine character gives opportunity for sympathetic thrills, but the experienced reader of detective stories feels fairly sure that an attractive feminine suspect is not the real criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-police&quot;&gt;The Police&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the police force are inevitable characters in Detective Fiction and have been presented in every possible light from a realistic picture of the actual Inspector to the ignorant and fanciful author's conception of the same. As these strong arms of the law must appear on our pages, let us endeavor to know whereof we speak, and learn a few simple and primitive facts about these people before we endeavor to portray them. It is amusing to read some of the absurd effects given to these clearly defined and easily recognized American citizens. Make them as picturesque as possible; give them dramatic, even humorous personality, but do not endow them with absurd responsibilities or official powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-supernumeraries&quot;&gt;The Supernumeraries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the supernumerary characters, the author must exercise his own taste and judgment, and he has fine scope for both. Of less importance in a short-story, they require merely to be kept in the background; but in a novel, they have their exits and their entrances, and play many, though subordinate parts. Each of these characters must have a positive and definite reason for being, and, if at all prominent, must be an inherent part of the plot. They are not to be scamped or slurred over in workmanship, for they are as important a part of the whole as the setting of a jewel or the binding of a book. They are the pence of a Detective Story, and must be taken care of; though in this case it does not follow that the pounds will take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective of modern fiction is a combination of the stock principles already noticed with such further and varying characteristics as the author may invent. In so far as the personal traits of the detective can differ from Sherlock Holmes, the author is so far less liable to the charge of plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-original-traits&quot;&gt;Some Original Traits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of how one of the later writers has invested his detective with fresh qualities may be noted in this extract from &quot;Midnight at Mears House,11 by Harrison J. Holt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the time of his coming to Mears House, Garth looked very much as he does to-day—a short, slight man of about my own age, well-built and energetic, but of a nervous rather than a muscular type of energy. He has grown a trifle stouter since, to be sure, but otherwise I can see little change in him. He was as bald then as he is now, and had the same trick of carrying his head a little to one side, as though the weight of it were too much for his neck to support. I have never seen a head more beautifully shaped than his, with a wide, high forehead, dark eyes far apart and rather prominent—it was hard to believe them blind—the nose and chin of an old Roman Emperor, and a somewhat small but finely modelled mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His ears, however, were the most remarkable of his features—not that they were unusual in shape or size, but because they were so low as to appear almost misplaced, and on account of their extraordinary quality. I doubt if anyone was ever gifted with a more wonderful sense of hearing. Certainly I have never met anybody, even among those bom blind, who could distinguish and interpret sound with such unerring, almost uncanny skill. Without this power—which he had developed to an altogether incredible degree—he could never have achieved the results he did: he has told me so many times. The tiniest noises, unremarked or meaningless to most people, were packed with significance to him. Each registered its own distinct, unequivocal impression, producing an emotion or resulting in a co-ordination of ideas which often enabled him to arrive instantly at the most momentous conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Especially was this the case in regard to the tones, inflection, and timbre of the human voice. From these he was able to deduct an astonishingly large number of facts concerning the person speaking—such as his age, nationality, occupation, physical and mental state of health, disposition, and character. This, as I am well aware, may strike the reader as fanciful and even preposterous. It seemed so to me at first, and yet I learned later that to a lesser degree this power of divination was no uncommon thing among the blind, though I have heard of very few instances in which it proved so uniformly infallible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I should not forget to mention as well a veritable sixth sense which he possessed—a sort of clairvoyance which made up in great measure for his lost sight. And yet clairvoyance is hardly the right word to describe it. It was rather as if he had some strange invisible organ of sensibility, some occult medium, by means of which he became aware of things seemingly beyond his apprehension. Doubtless a psychologist could state it far more intelligibly; I can only repeat that he had some such way of sensitizing himself, as it were, so as to receive impressions not communicable through the ordinary channels of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just how much this faculty, combined with his marvellously developed hearing, has aided him in his work, it would be hard to say. Personally I think he overestimates its value to him, and underrates the part his brain has played in the mastering of these abstruse problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without a very high degree of mental acuteness, the clearest and soundest of reasoning powers, and what-for want of a better word—I must call a sympathetic imagination, his unusual psychical and auditory perceptions would, I feel sure, have been of little help to him. It is, in my opinion, far more to the brilliant qualities of his mind, his marked analytical and synthetical abilities, and his unrivalled skill as a constructive logician, that he chiefly owes his success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, some authors try to give their detectives prominence by using methods exactly opposite to those of Sherlock Holmes. LeDroit Conners, in Samuel Gardenhire's book, &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; thus asserts his confidence in himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot understand how strongly such matters appeal to me. It is a faculty with me almost to know the solution of a crime when the leading circumstances connected with it are revealed. I form my conclusion first, and, confident of its correctness, hunt for evidence to sustain it. I do this because I am never wrong. It is not magic, telepathy, nor any form of mental science; it is a moral consciousness of the meaning of related facts, impressed upon my mind with unerring certainty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not understand you,&quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When I am given certain figures,&quot; he replied, &quot;the process of addition is instantaneous and sure. So, when I know of established incidents relating to a matter, they group themselves in my mind in such a manner as to reveal to me their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You say a gift developed; perhaps. Rather an instinct, as the faculty of scent to the blood-hound and the acute ear to the hare, an unfailing sight to the hawk and a sense of touch to the serpent. Deductive knowledge depends on reason, but inspiration is an exalted—no, perhaps I should say an acute sense of something else. The beasts, unclothed except by nature and unfed except by season and conquest, must make existence out of an absolute impression of certainty that is neither analytical nor deductive. I fear I am in that category, my dear fellow. I know things because I know them—that is, some things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is decidedly in contrast to Holmes' statement,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I make a point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foregoing is in line with this bit of Poe's wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrama of the idea that Marie Roget still lives, rather than any true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to L'Etoile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burton E. Stevenson works on this principle when his detective in &quot;The Holladay Case&quot; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we're too apt to overlook the simple explanations, which are, after all, nearly always the true ones. It's only in books that we meet the reverse. You remember it's Gaboriau who advises one always to distrust the probable?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes. I don't agree with him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Nor I.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is a dangerous experiment for inexperienced authors to put forward views heterodox to the accepted laws of Detective Fiction, and it must be done with skill and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Luther Trant's work, his scientific apparatus enables him to dispense with the more usual methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, thank you,&quot; he said, refusing the proffer of the paper. &quot;I read from the marks made upon minds by a crime, not from scrawls and thumbprints upon paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And my means of reading those marks are fortunately in my possession this morning. No, I do not mean that I have other evidence upon this case than that you have just given me, Mr. Eldredge,&quot; Trant explained. &quot;I refer to my psychological apparatus which, the express company notified me, arrived from New York this morning. If you will let me have my appliance delivered direct to your house it will save much time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-unique-detectives&quot;&gt;Two Unique Detectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rouletabille appreciated the dramatic value of what Poe called the pungent contradiction of the general idea. In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,11 by Gaston Leroux, the following conversation occurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you any idea as to the murderer's station in life?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied; &quot;I think if he isn't a man in society, he is, at least, a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an impression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What has led you to form it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,—the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the rough boots on the floor,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I understand,&quot; I said; &quot;murderers don't leave traces behind them which tell the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sain- clair,&quot; concluded Rouletabille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Lecoq, this young man was not infallible; but his author made him this way for the same reason. Because he figures in a novel, and the infallible detective must do his work in a short- story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rouletabille's strong card is pure reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How did you come to suspect Larsan?&quot; asked the President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My pure reason pointed to him. But I did not foresee the drugging. He is very cunning. Yes, my pure reason pointed to him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean by your pure reason?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That power of one's mind which admits of no disturbing elements to a conclusion. The day following the incident of 'the inexplicable gallery,' I felt myself losing control of it.        I had allowed myself to be diverted by fallacious evidence; but I recovered and again took hold of the right end.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;M. Sainclair, you ought to know that I never suspect any person or anything without previously having satisfied myself upon the 'ground of pure reason.1 That is a solid staff which has never yet failed me on the toad and on which I invite you all to lean with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His pure reason is of the subtlest variety, and his fine work throughout the book commands always the admiration of the connoisseur. In a seemingly inexplicable situation he exclaims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Let us reason it out!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And he returned on the instant to that argument which lad already served us and which he repeated again and again to himself (in order that, he said, he should not be lured away by the outer appearance of things): &quot;Do not look for Larsan in that place where he reveals himself; seek for him everywhere else where he hides himself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This he followed up with the supplementary argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He never shows himself where he seems to be except to prevent us from seeing him where he really is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And he resumed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah! the outer appearance of things! Look here. Sain- clair! There are moments when, for the sake of reasoning clearly, I want to get rid of my eyes! Let us get rid of our eyes, Sainclair, for five minutes—just five minutes, and, perhaps, we shall see more clearly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rouletabille's subtlety of reasoning rose almost to clairvoyance. In his desperate endeavors to discover the identity of Larsan, he relates his experience thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And why did all the others sit so silent and so motionless behind their dark glasses? All at once, I turned my head and looked behind me. Then I understood, more by instinct than anything else, that I was the object of a common physical attraction. Someone was looking at me. Two eyes were fixed upon me—weighing upon me. I could not see the eyes and I did not know from where the glance fixed upon me came, but it was there. I knew it—and it was his glance. But there was no one behind me, nor at the right, nor the left, nor in front, except the people who were seated at the table, motionless, behind their dark glasses. And then—then I knew that Larsan's eyes were glaring at me from behind a pair of those glasses—ah! the dark glasses,—the dark glasses behind which were hidden Larsan's eyes. If I mention this incident here, it is for the purpose of showing to how great an extent I was haunted by the image of Larsan, hiding under some new form, and lurking unknown among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Heaven! Larsan had so often proved his talent—I may even say his genius—in this respect, that I felt that he was quite capable of defying us now, and of mingling with us while we thought that he was a stranger—or, perhaps, even a friend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fearful is he that one of the seemingly well-known people about him may be Larsan in disguise, that he says to Sainclair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hold your left hand in your right for five minutes and then ask yourself: 'Is it you, Larsan?' And when you have replied to yourself, do not feel too sure, for he may, perhaps, have lied to you, and he may be in your own skin without your knowing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing imitative about this young detective. His methods are unique. His pure reasoning is most subtle; and though the farthest possible remove from realism it presents a semblance of reality that is entirely convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man&quot; Mr. Henry Kitchell Webster employs a very different principle for the use of his detective. It may be called the principle of The Inspired Guess, and though improbable, perhaps not more so than the laws of detective fiction permit. The Whispering Man thus describes it himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I had happened to tell him once that I believed that I always knew a criminal when I saw one, without knowing how or why—by just looking at him. He didn't scout that theory as you would if I were to give you a chance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And you believed all the while,&quot; I repeated, incredulously, &quot;that McWilliams was the man?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not believed; knew. Oh, I don't know how. That's the whole point. That's what I've been preaching all the evening. The only certain knowledge is the inspired guess.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable Detectives of Fiction is Mr. Zangwill's Grodman, who in &quot;Big Bow Mystery,&quot; thus discourses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It grew daily clearer to me that criminals were more fools than rogues. Every crime I had traced, however cleverly perpetrated, was from the point of view of penetrability a weak failure. Traces and trails were left on all sides—ragged edges, rough-hewn corners; in short, the job was botched, artistic completeness unattained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To the vulgar, my feats might seem marvelous—the average man is mystified to grasp how you detect the letter 'e1 in a simple cryptogram—to myself they were as commonplace as the crimes they unveiled. To me now, with my lifelong study of the science of evidence, it seemed possible to commit not merely one, but a thousand crimes that should be absolutely undiscoverable. And yet criminals would go on sinning, and giving themselves away, in the same old grooves—no originality, no dash, no individual insight, no fresh conception! One would imagine there were an Academy of crime with forty thousand armchairs. And gradually, as I pondered and brooded over the thought, there came upon me the desire to commit a crime that should baffle detection. I could invent hundreds of such crimes, and please myself by imagining them done but would they really work out in practice? Evidently the sole performer of my experiment must be myself; the subject whom or what? Accident should determine. I itched to commence with murder—to tackle the stiffest problems first, and I burned to startle and baffle the world—especially the world of which I had ceased to be. Outwardly I was calm, and spoke to the people about me as usual. Inwardly I was on fire with a consuming scientific passion. I sported with my pet theories, and fitted them mentally on every one I met. Every friend or acquaintance I sat and gossiped with, I was plotting how to murder without leaving a clue. There is not one of my friends or acquaintances I have not done away with in thought. There is no public man—have no fear, my dear Home Secretary—I have not planned to assassinate secretly, mysteriously, unintelligibly, undiscoverably. Ah, how I could give the stock criminals points with their second-hand motives, their conventional conceptions, their commonplace details, their lack of artistic feeling and restraint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the same book, we get this description of the contrasting official detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wimp was at his greatest in collecting circumstantial evidence; in putting two and two together to make five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He would collect together a number of dark and disconnected data and flash across them the electric light of some unifying hypothesis in a way which would have done credit to a Darwin or a Faraday. An intellect which might have served to unveil the secret workings of nature was subverted to the protection of a capitalistic civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that the greatest Detective Stories, short or long, have been written around a murder. Poe, Gaboriau, Conan Doyle, and Anna Katharine Green all look upon murder as the theme par excellence for a Detective Story, and other crimes are used by authors only as a relief from monotony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human nature thinks more lightly of robbery, or arson; but murder stirs up a spirit of righteous indignation and a desire for justice or revenge. &quot;A life for a life&quot; is the logical sequence of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and a murder mystery will hold a reader's interest when a lesser crime will pall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;murder-considered-in-the-abstract&quot;&gt;Murder Considered in the Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, first of all, let us dissociate the real horror felt at a real murder, from a murder plot used as a peg on which to hang the absorbing puzzle meant to enthrall the intellect. People who say, &quot;How can you enjoy reading about such a revolting subject as murder?&quot; are unable to discern the difference between a realistic newspaper story and a carefully planned romance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for reading newspaper accounts of a real murder trial are absolutely separate and distinct from the reasons for reading a Detective Story. The latter is an absorbing mental occupation, with a setting of human interest that differentiates it from a mere mathematical problem. If the reader is thrilled, it is through the intellect, not through the emotions. Sympathy is not called for; pity is not kindled; every situation is viewed by the cold light of reasoning. The whole affair is entirely divested of the sentiment that would surround it in real life. As Charles Lamb says of dramatic art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We dare not dally with images, or names, of wrong. We bark like foolish dogs at shadows. We dread infection from the scenic representation of disorder; and fear a painted pustule. In our anxiety that our morality should not take cold, we wrap it up in a great blanket surtout of precaution against the breeze and sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I confess for myself that I am glad for a season to take an airing beyond the diocese of the strict conscience, now and then, for a dreamwhile or so, to imagine a world with no meddling restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I come back to my cage and my restraint the fresher and more healthy for it. I wear my shackles more contentedly for having respired the breath of an imaginary freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am the gayer at least for it; and I could never connect those sports of a witty fancy in any shape with any result to be drawn from them to imitation in real life. They are a world of themselves almost as much as fairyland.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of a criminal he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In its own world do we feel the creature is so very bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In their own sphere, they do not offend my moral sense; in fact, they do not appeal to it at all. They seem engaged in their proper element. They break through no laws, or conscientious restraints. They know of none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have got out of Christendom into the land—what shall I call it? The Utopia of gallantry, where pleasure is duty, and the manners perfect freedom. It is altogether a speculative scene of things, which has no reference whatever to the world that is. No good person can be justly offended as a spectator, because no good person suffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole is a passing pageant, where we should sit as unconcerned at the issues, for life or death, as at a battle of the frogs and mice. But like Don Quixote, we take part against the puppets, and quite as impertinently. We dare not contemplate an Atlantis, a scheme, out of which our coxcombial moral sense is for a little transitory ease excluded. We have not the courage to imagine a state of things for which there is neither reward nor punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We cling to the painful necessities of shame and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We would indict our dreams.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, the reader is transported to a pleasant land of burglary and murder, which is acceptable—because it is not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One need not be of a murderous instinct to enjoy the story of &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue.&quot; How many happily married people read stories of divorce; how many just and upright citizens read tales of men who succumb to temptation; how many strictly conventional people enjoyed &quot;Trilby.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the devotee of the Detective Story must be willing, for the time being, to look upon murder as a fine art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;murder-as-a-fine-art&quot;&gt;Murder as a Fine Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact point of view is perfectly set forth in De Quincey's essay with that title. I wish I might quote it all here the delicious satire that is yet sound philosophy, is marred by separation from its context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a few passages may be given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;People begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killed—a knife—a purse—and a dark lane. Design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry, sentiment, are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature. Mr. Williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us; and to me, therefore, in particular, has deepened the arduousness of my task. Like Aeschylus or Milton in poetry, like Michael Angelo in painting, he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity; and, as Mr. Wordsworth observes, has in a manner 'created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.' To sketch the history of the art, and to examine its principles critically, now remains as a duty for the connoisseur, and forjudges of quite another stamp from his Majesty's Judges of Assize.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the right spirit in which to read of a murder in Detective Fiction. De Quincey goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The murder was a sad thing, no doubt, very sad; but we can't mend it. Therefore, let us make the best of a bad matter; and, as it is impossible to hammer any thing out of it for moral purposes, let us treat it aesthetically, and see if it will turn to account in that way. Such is the logic of a sensible man, and what follows? We dry up our tears, and have the satisfaction, perhaps, to discover that a transaction, which, morally considered, was shocking, and without a leg to stand upon, when tried by principles of Taste, turns out to be a very meritorious performance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in his whimsical mood, De Quincey thus goes back to Ancient History:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The first murder is familiar to you all. As the inventor of murder, and the father of the art, Cain must have been a man of first-rate genius. All the Cains were men of genius. Tubal Cain invented tubes, I think, or some such thing. But, whatever might be the originality and genius of the artist, every art was then in its infancy, and the works must be criticized with a recollection of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even Tubal's work would probably be little approved at this day in Sheffield; and therefore of Cain (Cain senior, I mean) it is no disparagement to say, that his performance was but so-so. Milton, however, is supposed to have thought differently. By his way of relating the case, it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with him, for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect:—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;'Whereat he inly raged; and, as they talk'd,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;Smote him in the midriff with a stone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;That beat out life: he fell; and, deadly pale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;Groan'd out his soul with gushing blood effused.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;-Paradise Lost, Book XI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following history's list, we learn that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The finest work of the seventeenth century is, unquestionably, the murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, which has my entire approbation. In the grand feature of mystery, which in some shape or other ought to color every judicious attempt at murder, it is excellent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another excellent affair is mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The King of Sweden's assassination, by-the-by, is doubted by many writers, Harte amongst others; but they are wrong. He was murdered; and I consider his murder unique in its excellence; for he was murdered at noon-day, and on the field of battle—a feature of original conception, which occurs in no other work of art that I remember. No unpracticed artist could have conceived so bold an idea as that of a noonday murder in the heart of a great city. It was no obscure baker, gentlemen, or anonymous chimney-sweeper, be assured, that executed this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;With respect to the Williams' murders, the sublimes&quot; and most entire in their excellence that ever were committed, I shall not allow myself to speak incidentally. Nothing less than an entire lecture, or even an entire course of lectures, would suffice to expound their merits. Indeed, all of these assassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur. They are all of them exemplaria, model murders, pattern murders of which one may say,—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'&quot;Nocturna versate menu, versate diurna,1 especially nocturna.&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing this remarkable essay, we come upon this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But it is now time that I should say a few words about the principles of murder, not with a view to regulate your practice, but your judgment: as to old women, and the mob of newspaper readers, they are pleased with anything, provided it is bloody enough, but the mind of sensibility requires something more. First, then let us speak of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer; secondly, of the place where; thirdly, of the time when, and other little circumstances. &quot;As to the person, I suppose that it is evident that he ought to be a good man; because, if he were not, he might himself, by possibility, be contemplating murder at the very time; and such 'diamond-cut-diamond' tussles, though pleasant enough where nothing better is stirring, are really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders. I could mention some people (I name no names) who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane; and so far all seemed correct enough but on looking farther into the matter, the public have become aware that the murdered party was himself, at the moment, planning to rob his murderer, at the least, and possibly to murder him, if he had been strong enough. Whenever that is the case, or may be thought to be the case, farewell to all the genuine effects of the art.11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The subject chosen ought to be in good health: for it is absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person, who is usually quite unable to bear it. On this principle, no tailor ought to be chosen who is above twenty-five, for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;So much for the person. As to the time, the place, the tools, I have many things to say, which at present I have no room for. The good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy. Yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with excellent effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As might be supposed, this essay of De Quincey's brought forth various criticisms. To these he replies in another essay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A good many years age, the reader may remember that I came forward in the character of a dilettante in murder. Perhaps dilettante is too strong a word. Connoisseur is better suited to the scruples and infirmity of public taste. I suppose there is no harm in that, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A man is not bound to put his eyes, ears, and understanding into his breeches-pocket when he meets with a murder. If he is not in a downright comatose state, I suppose he must see that one murder is better or worse than another, in point of good taste. Murders have their little differences and shades of merit, as well as statues, pictures, oratorios, cameos, intaglios, or what not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am for morality, and always shall be, and for virtue, and all that; and I do affirm and always shall (let what will come of it), that murder is an improper line of conduct, highly improper; and I do not stick to assert, that any man who deals in murder, must have very incorrect ways of thinking, and truly inaccurate principles; and so far from aiding and abetting him by pointing out his victim's hiding place, as a great moralist of Germany declared it to be every good man's duty to do, I would subscribe one shilling and sixpence to have him apprehended, which is more by eighteen pence than the most eminent moralists have hitherto subscribed for that purpose. But what then? Everything in this world has two handles. Murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle (as it generally is in the pulpit, and at the Old Bailey); and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste. Genius may do much, but long study of the art must always entitle a man to offer advice. So far I will go—general principles I will suggest. But as to any particular case, once for all I will have nothing to do with it. Never tell me of any special work of art you are meditating—I set my face against it in toto. For, if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination. Once begin upon this downward path, you never know where you are to stop. Many a man has dated his ruin from some murder or other that perhaps he thought little of at the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though written in a whimsical vein, these observations of De Quincey apply definitely to the Murder Fanciers of Detective Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare's murders are calmly accepted on the stage, and our children are placidly told Who Killed Cock Robin because these killings are not true, but are merely the manufactures of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-murder-theme&quot;&gt;The Murder Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a proof that murder, or apparent murder, or attempted murder, is the favorite theme with our best detective writers, we may note these statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two-score-odd Sherlock Holmes stories, more than twenty have murder as the crime; and this, in spite of his assertion in &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; that &quot;there are many interesting little problems for detectives which are striking and bizarre without being criminal.&quot; Yet in more than half of his stories, Conan Doyle uses a murder motive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Poe's three Dupin stories, two are based on murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques Futrelle in his clever &quot;Thinking Machine&quot; stories, employs murder as an interest in eight out of nineteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Samuel Gardenhire's eight stories in &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; five are murder stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on, through all the books of short stories, each volume of which narrates the exploits of a Transcendent Detective, the average of the murder plot is more than one- half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novels of detective fiction almost invariably use a murder plot. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is an exception; but nearly all of Gaboriau's, Du Boisgobey's, Anna Katharine Green's and Ottolengui's are murder mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-robbery-theme&quot;&gt;The Robbery Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After murder, robbery is next in favor as a crime for detective fiction. It is not easy to create intense interest in a robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Sir Walter Besant on this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Consider—say, a diamond robbery. Very well; then first of all, it must be a robbery committed under exceptional any mysterious conditions, otherwise there will be no interest in it. Also, you will perceive that the robbery must be a big and important thing—no little shop-lifting business. Next, the person robbed must not be a mere diamond merchant, but a person whose loss will interest the reader, say, one to whom the robbery is all-important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conditions are all perfectly observed in &quot;The Moonstone. Indeed, so well did Wilkie Collins know that the jewel must be of not only enormous but peculiar value, that he thus describes it, through the medium of the old House Steward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Lord bless us! It was a Diamond! As large, or nearly, as a plover's egg! The light that streamed from it was like the light of the harvest-moon. When you looked down into the stone, you looked into a yellow deep that drew your eyes into it so that they saw nothing else. It seemed unfathomable; this jewel, that you could hold between your finger and thumb, seemed unfathomable as the heavens themselves. We set it in the sun, and then shut the light out of the room, and it shone awfully out of the depths of its own brightness, with a moony gleam, in the dark. No wonder Miss Rachel was fascinated; no wonder her cousins screamed. The Diamond laid such a hold on me that I burst out with as large an 'O!1 as the Bouncers themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even before this description, the Diamond had been given a value quite other than intrinsic. It was a historic gem famous in the native annals of India. It was the subject of tradition and superstition, and it had been having adventures since the eleventh century. It had been the reason for theft and bloodshed, and was the cause of a family feud. All this interest in addition to the setting of the story, the personality of the characters and the adroit art of Wilkie Collins, causes the mystery to be a worth-while one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A later story of a jewel robbery is found in Robert Barr's book, called &quot;The Triumphs of Eugene Valmont.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is built around a diamond necklace which a court jeweler made, hoping to sell to Marie Antoinette. It contained half a thousand marvelous stones and had been through desperate adventures for many years. After its thrilling history is narrated the necklace is thus introduced to the reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The jeweler who made the necklace met with financial ruin; the Queen for whom it was constructed was beheaded; that high-born prince, Louis Rene Edouard, Cardinal de Rohan, who purchased it, was flung into prison; the unfortunate countess, who said she acted as go- between until the transfer was concluded, clung for five awful minutes to a London window sill before dropping to her death to the flags below; and now, a hundred and eight years later, up comes this devil's display of fireworks to the light again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These preliminaries, though so similar to those employed in &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; are in no sense a plagiarism. They are the legitimate methods of whetting the reader's interest in a robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau's &quot;File No. 113&quot; hinges on a robbery. This, a bank robbery, is not a great one, the sum of $70,000 being stolen. But the popularity of the story is caused by the skill of the detective Lecoq and the contrasting inefficiency of a younger detective in unraveling the complicated web of circumstances. As is usual with Gaboriau, the story is spun out to a tiresome length; and the simple plot of the robbery, the clue of the scratch on the safe and the mixed-up social relations of the characters are presented as a novel, when they are barely enough material for a novelette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robberies other than of jewels or money are sometimes thefts of valuable papers. These papers are often of political import, and not infrequently are of such nature that their falling into wrong hands would precipitate dire and disastrous war among the greatest of the world's powers. Naval treatises, war maps, or specifications for astonishing new inventions in the way of explosives, are among the most used sorts, followed closely by wills, love letters, photographs, and, in one instance at least, college examination papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's &quot;Purloined Letter&quot; is the first and best of these stories; but the value of that masterpiece is more in the work of the detective than in the actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; is a similar plot with an incriminating photograph for the booty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theft stories are built, too, around antiques or curios, idols, heirlooms, and, especially since the disappearance of the Mona Lisa, around valuable paintings. There was even a very clever and original story written about the theft of the Venus of Milo from the Louvre; and this some years before the abstraction of the Mona Lisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any article will do for fiction robbery, provided it be of exceeding great value, either intrinsically or by association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Sherlock Holmes stories, one-quarter hinge on robbery as against one-half on murder. Next in favor is mysterious disappearance, or abduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mysterious-disappearance&quot;&gt;The Mysterious Disappearance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kidnapping of children is unpopular, as it is difficult to eliminate personal feeling when a child is brought into the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel N. Gardenhire thus refers to it in &quot;The Abduction of Mary Ellis&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The stealing of children,&quot; he said, reflectively, &quot;is probably the most unpopular crime that can be committed in this country. It is not indigenous to the soil. It is an exotic—an imported offence, one that has best thriven in communities where the poor are oppressed by the rich and where the element of revenge is combined with the instinct of greed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Millionaire Baby,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green, is perhaps a unique instance of a full-sized book with a kidnapping case for its theme. But treated by this skillful author it is in all respects a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Luther Trant stories, a kidnapping mystery is well solved in &quot;The Red Dress&quot;; and in &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; Astro happily rescues a kidnapped child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes' nearest approach to a child-stealing case is the tracing of a missing school-boy in &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abduction of older girls, or young women, is more often narrated, &quot;The Strange Disappearance of Eleanor Cuyler,&quot; and &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green, being among the best examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mysterious disappearance, though not necessarily abduction, is always a useful theme. In &quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor,&quot; Sherlock Holmes remarks thus on the disappearance of a bride during her own wedding breakfast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Before the what?&quot; asked Holmes with a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The vanishing of the lady.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When did she vanish, then?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At the wedding breakfast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic in fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honey-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man is abducted in &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three- Quarter,&quot; value being given to this particular man because he is a three-quarter in a celebrated football team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other authors average much the same as Conan Doyle; and, to sum up, we find that throughout Detective Fiction half of the stories are murder mysteries, one quarter are robberies, and the other quarter is divided among crimes more or less dramatic or picturesque. These include forgery, counterfeiting, blackmail, arson, dynamiting, body-snatching, and other rare and even unique crimes invented by a daring author for a jaded public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;more-devices&quot;&gt;MORE DEVICES&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tabulated-clues&quot;&gt;Tabulated Clues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good device for the use of the Detective Story Writer is a list or catalog of clues, evidences, or suspects. A distinct tabulation serves to lay the conditions of the story clearly before the reader, and arouses his curiosity as to their meaning and consequences. Of course, if need be, the clues may be misleading; but if done properly, that, too, is a legitimate device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins appreciated the use of this tabulation, and thus summed up the opening situation in &quot;The Moonstone&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Follow me carefully, Betteredge; and count me off on your fingers, if it will help you,&quot; says Mr. Franklin, with a certain pleasure in showing how clear-headed he could be, which reminded me wonderfully of old times when he was a boy. &quot;Question the first: Was the Colonel's Diamond the object of a conspiracy in India? Question the second: Has the conspiracy followed the Colonel's Diamond to England? Question the third: Did the Colonel know the conspiracy followed the Diamond; and has he purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister, through the innocent medium of his sister's child?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much later in the story he again uses this device, purposely to mislead the reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As to the person, or persons, by whom the crime was committed: It is known (1) that the Indians had an interest in possessing themselves of the Diamond. (2) It is at least probable that the man looking like an Indian, whom Octavius Guy saw at the window of the cab speaking to the man dressed like a mechanic, was one of the three Hindoo conspirators. (3) It is certain that this same man, dressed like a mechanic, was seen keeping Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite in view all through the evening of the twenty-sixth, and was found in the bedroom (before Mr. Ablewhite was shown into it) under circumstances which lead to the suspicion that he was examining the room. (4) A morsel of torn gold thread was picked up in the bedroom, which persons expert in such matters declared to be of Indian manufacture and to be a species of gold thread not known in England. (5) On the morning of the twenty-seventh, three men, answering to the description of the three Indians, were observed in lower Thames Street were traced to the Tower Wharf, and were seen to leave London by the steamer bound for Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is here moral, if not legal, evidence that the murder was committed by the Indians.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how cleverly he makes it seem certain that the crime was committed by the Indians. In a long and somewhat rambling tale like &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; a concise summary of evidence now and then is exceedingly effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green frequently makes use of listed statistics. In &quot;That Affair Next Door,&quot; the heroine, who is doing detective work, makes a list, which is here given in part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having, as I thought, noticed some few facts in connection with it, from which conclusions might be drawn, I amused myself with jotting them down on the back of a disputed grocer's bill I happened to find in my pocket. Valueless as explaining this tragedy, being founded upon insufficient evidence, they may be interesting as showing the workings of my mind even at this early stage of the matter. They were drawn up under three heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, was the death of this young woman an accident? Second, was it a suicide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Third, was it a murder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the first head I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My reasons for not thinking it an accident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it bad been an accident and she had pulled the cabinet over upon herself, she would have been found with her feet pointing towards the wall where the cabinet had stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(But her feet were towards the door and her head under the cabinet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The decent, even precise, arrangement of the clothing about her feet, which precludes any theory involving accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the second:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reason for not thinking it suicide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She could not have been found in the position observed without having lain down on the floor while living and then pulled the shelves down upon herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(A theory obviously too improbable to be considered.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the third:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reason for not thinking it murder, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the principals in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; by Mary Roberts Rinehart, makes a similar list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I made out a list of questions and possible answers, but I seemed only to be working around in a circle. I always ended where I began. The list was something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who had entered the house the night before the murder? Thomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on the footpath, and who owned the pearl cuff-link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the house the night he was killed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No answer. Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned? Who admitted him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gertrude said she had locked the east entry. There was no key on the dead man or in the door. He must have been admitted from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who had been locked in the clothes chute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Someone unfamiliar with the house, evidently. Only two people missing from the household, Rosie and Gertrude. Rosie had been at the lodge. Therefore—but was it Gertrude? Might it not have been the mysterious intruder again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Holladay Case,&quot; Mr. Burton E. Stevenson tells us that his detective &quot;drew up a resume of the case—to clear the atmosphere, as it were.&quot; It ran something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 13, Thursday—Holladay found murdered; daughter drives to Washington Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 14, Friday—Coroner's inquest; Miss Holladay released; mysterious note received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 16, Sunday—Holladay buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 18, Tuesday—Will opened and probated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 28, Friday—Miss Holladay returns from drive, bringing new maid with her and discharges old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 29, Saturday—Gives orders to open summer house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 1, Tuesday—Asks for $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 2, Wednesday—Gets it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 3, Thursday—Leaves home ostensibly for Belair, in company with new maid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 14, Monday—Butler reports her disappearance;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Royce taken ill; I begin my search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There I stopped. The last entry brought me up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cleverest lists, for the purpose of telling the story is one in &quot;The Leavenworth Case,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking a piece of paper, I jotted down the leading causes of suspicion as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her late disagreement with her uncle, and evident estrangement from him, as testified to by Mr. Harwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mysterious disappearance of one of the servants of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The forcible accusation made by her cousin—over- heard, however, only by Mr. Gryce and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her equivocation in regard to the handkerchief found stained with pistol smut on the scene of the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her refusal to speak in regard to the paper which she was supposed to have taken from Mr. Leavenworth's table immediately upon the removal of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The finding of the library key in her possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A dark record,&quot; I involuntarily decided, as I looked it over; but even in doing so began jotting down on the other side of the sheet the following explanatory notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Disagreements and even estrangements between relatives are common. Cases where such disagreements and estrangements have led to crime, rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The disappearance of Hannah points no more certainly in one direction than another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If Mary's private accusation of her cousin was forcible and convincing, her public declaration that she neither knew nor suspected who might be the author of this crime, was equally so. To be sure, the former possessed the advantage of being uttered spontaneously, but it was likewise true that it was spoken under momentary excitement, without foresight of the consequences, and possibly without due consideration of the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An innocent man or woman, under the influence of terror, will often equivocate in regard to matters that seem to criminate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here much of the problem is clearly stated in the first half of the list, and the working out of the solution is definitely indicated in the second part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed suggestions are more useful in books than in short- stories; for in the former the complexities of the plot are more likely to need occasional rounding up and recalling to view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worn-out-devices&quot;&gt;Worn-out Devices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trite and greatly worn device is the watch that stopped presumably when the crime was committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a typical use of this incident quoted from R. Ottolengui's &quot;The Crime of the Century&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I found Mr. Mora's watch under the bed, where it must have been knocked from the dressing-table. The fall had caused it to stop, and the hands indicated seven minutes of two, agreeing with the time during which the watchman testifies that young Mora was at home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Mitchel, &quot;but do not go too fast. The watch may have run down. It is uncommon for a good watch to stop merely because it falls to the floor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Both of your points are good, in theory,&quot; replied the detective &quot;But neither applies in this instance. If a watch runs down, it cannot be started again without winding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By merely shaking this one I set it going, and to make assurance doubly sure, I let it run for an hour, when it was still keeping time. Next, though it be true that most watches would not be so easily stopped, this one, for some reason, is very sensitive to a blow. I tried the experiment of pushing it from the table to the floor, and at every attempt I found that it would cease its movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of a stopped watch is so obvious that it led authors at once to the idea of purposely stopping a watch with the intent of leading the detective and the reader astray. In fact, this was done as long ago as in Gaboriau's &quot;Crime of Orcival,&quot; where Lecoq, finding a clock which has been overturned in the struggle between the victim and his assassin, purposely turns the hands some four hours backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device has been used so often that the astute reader now disregards the evidence of the stopped watch in fiction. But still the clock or watch may play an important part in the plot, if managed with any degree of originality. In &quot;The Quests of Paul Beck&quot; the device is well used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Beck looked at the German with manifest admiration. &quot;Forgive me for mentioning it. You would have made a first-class detective if you hadn't gone into another line of business. I should have told you that the evidence of the watch had been faked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Faked?&quot; queried the other, with a blank look on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh! I see. Being a German, of course you don't understand our slang phrases. I examined the watch, and found that though the glass had been violently broken, the dial was not even scratched. The spring had been snapped, not by the blow but by overwinding. It was pretty plain to me the murderer had done the trick. He first put the hands on to half-past eight and then broke the spring, and so made his alibi. He got the watch to perjure itself. Neat, wasn't it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The German merely grunted. He was plainly impressed by the devilish ingenuity of the murderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; by Henry Kitchell Webster, a large office clock seen in a mirror, makes twenty minutes before twelve appear to be twenty minutes after twelve, which leads to worth-while complications, and proves a clever device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brander Matthews' story, &quot;The Twinkling of an Eye,&quot; a clock is used to conceal and manipulate a camera for the purposes of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any such original application of commonplace material is worth-while in detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another maneuvre that has lost its grip on the attention of the trained reader, is the clumsily-upset table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Reigate Puzzle,&quot; Dr. Watson tells us;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it. Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room. You've done it now, Watson,&quot; said he, coolly. &quot;A pretty mess you've made of the carpet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident was effective and of importance as Conan Doyle used it, but it has since been done so often as to have lost its power to surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hackneyed misleading device is that of high words between a victim and a suspect. In Chekhov's Russian story, &quot;The Safety Match,&quot; the author thus tries to cast suspicion on the valet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The master's valet, your worship,&quot; answered Ephraim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Who else could it be? He's a rascal, your worship! He's a drunkard and a blackguard, the like of which Heaven should not permit! He always took the master his vodka and put the master to bed. Who else could it be? And I also venture to point out to your worship, he once boasted at the public-house that he would kill the master!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea was right enough when first used; but experience has taught the modern reader that the one who threatens, or boasts an intent to kill never does so. The man who is overheard quarrelling with the victim just before his death is never by any chance the criminal in Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whispered words is a legitimate though slightly overworked way of preserving the secret. One character whispers to another something the reader is not allowed to overhear. This rouses the eavesdropping instinct latent in every human mind, and the reader scans the pages in endeavor to learn that whispered message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But attentive reading of the best detective stories will soonest teach a writer what devices may be used effectively and what not. It is a matter of taste, originality and cleverness. Even a trite device may be used with a new turn or twist and prove of great value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the longest roll of hackneyed devices in one book is found in &quot;That Mainwaring Affair,&quot; by A.M. Barbour. This is a most excellent and interesting story and of exceedingly good construction. The surprise is perfect and the plot original, but old and time-worn devices are repeatedly used. It includes the return of a long-lost brother, supposed to have been shipwrecked years before; stolen family jewels, a missing will; a twin brother; a birthmark identification; an illegitimate son of a designing housekeeper; a suspected private secretary; whispered words conveying the secret; a dragged lake; and innumerable disguises. All of these are justifiable, but a writer will do well to strike out on more original lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-use-of-disguise&quot;&gt;The Use of Disguise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disguise is not so much employed now as in former years when Lecoq was young. And the general public is now more keen to see through false whiskers than in the old days when Vidocq made his fame. Both these celebrated detectives were experts in the art of disguise. To quote from Vidocq's Memoirs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At last, by dint of much effort of memory, I recalled to mind one Germain, alias &quot;the Captain,&quot; who had been an intimate acquaintance of Noel's, and although our similarity was very slight, yet I determined on personating him. Germain, as well as myself, had often escaped from the Bagnes, and that was the only point of resemblance between us; he was about my age, but a smaller-framed man, he had dark brown hair, mine was light; he was thin, and I tolerably stout; his complexion was sallow, and mine fair, with a very clear skin; besides, Germain had an excessively long nose, took a vast deal of snuff which, begriming his nostrils outside, and stuffing them up within, gave him a peculiarly nasal tone of voice. I had much to do in personating Germain; but the difficulty did not deter me; my hair, cut a la mode des Bagnes, was dyed black, as well as my beard, after it had attained a growth of eight days; to embrown my countenance I washed it with white walnut liquor; and to perfect the imitation, I garnished my upper lip thickly with a kind of coffee grounds, which I plastered on by means of gum-arabic, and thus became as nasal in my twang as Germain himself. My feet were doctored with equal care; I made blisters on them by rubbing in a certain composition, of which I had obtained the receipt at Brest. I also made the marks of the fetters; and when all my toilet was finished, dressed myself in the suitable garb. I had neglected nothing which could complete the metamorphosis,—neither the shoes nor the marks of those horrid letters G.A.L. The costume was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I were your lieutenant, and wanted to take Vidocq,&quot; replied I, &quot;I would contrive that he should not escape me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You! Oh yes, you and everybody! He is always completely armed. You know they said that he fired twice at Delrue and Carpentier; and that is not all, for he can change himself into a bundle of hay whenever he likes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A bundle of hay!&quot; cried I, surprised at the novel endowment assigned to me. &quot;A bundle of hay! How?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, sir; my father pursued him one day, and at the moment he laid his hand upon his collar, he found that he only held a handful of hay. He did not only say it, but all the brigade saw the bundle of hay, which was burnt in the barrackyard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq also depends largely on disguises for his successes. He says himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A detective who is worth his salt can give an actor any amount of lessons. Since last year I have been studying the art of disguising my face, and I can at my desire become short or tall, dark or fair a perfect gentleman, or the vilest scoundrel that hangs about the outskirts of the suburbs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &quot;File No. 113&quot; we are told:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His amazement gave so singular an expression to his face that M. Lecoq could not restrain a smile. &quot;Then it was you!&quot; continued the bewildered detective; &quot;you were the stout gentleman at whom I stared, so as to impress his appearance upon my mind, and I never recognized you! You would make a superb actor, my chief, if you would go on the stage; but I was disguised too—very well disguised.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Very poorly disguised: it is only just to you that I should let you know what a failure it was, Fanferlot. Do you think that a huge beard and a blouse are a sufficient transformation? The eye is the thing to be changed—the eye! The art lies in being able to change the eye. That is the secret.&quot; This theory of disguise explained why the lynx-eyed Lecoq never appeared at the Prefecture of Police without his gold spectacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You can't swear to that because no one can boast of knowing the real face of M. Lecoq. It is one thing today, and another tomorrow; sometimes he is a dark man, sometimes a fair one, sometimes quite young, and then an octogenarian. Why, at times he even deceives me. I begin to talk to a stranger—bah! it turns out to be M. Lecoq! Anybody on the face of the earth might be he. If I were told that you were he, I should say 'Very likely it is so.' Ah! he can convert himself into any form he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He is a wonderful man!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of modern fictive detectives, few use disguise to great extent, with the exception perhaps of Frederic Larsan in the books of Gaston Leroux. So punctilious was this French detective in the details of his disguise, that his young opponent himself admitted that Larsan's disguises were impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And Old Bob?&quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, dear boy, no!&quot; scoffed Rouletabille, almost angrily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not he, either. You have noticed that he wears a wig, I suppose. Well, I assure you that when Larsan wears a wig, it will fit him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so perfectly did Larsan's wigs fit him, as well as all the other details of his disguise, that he assumed the personality of any one at will, without fear of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes often assumed disguise, but Conan Doyle does not make a strong point of it, relying not so much on physical appearances as on acute mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-quotpropertiesquot&quot;&gt;Other &quot;Properties&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pet device is the discovery of a torn bit of paper containing part of a written communication. The writing is usually readable, but incomprehensible for want of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very bunglingly done by Vidocq, who finds a torn scrap of an envelope with these words on it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Monsieur Rao—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marchand de vins, bar—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Roche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and after much effort, mental and otherwise, he thus solved the enigma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The torn address was, in my estimation, an enigma, which must first be solved; and, to effect this, I racked my brains day and night and at last felt satisfied, that excepting the name (respecting which I had but few doubts) the perfect address would run thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Monsieur—, Marchand de vins,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barriere Rochechouart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chaussee de Clignancourt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, better managed, a torn bit of paper is helpful in rousing the reader's curiosity and there are few authors who have not utilized it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle goes farther, in using what seems to be part of a woman's name, &quot;Rache,&quot; but is really a whole word in German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green gives an original twist to this old idea in her title, &quot;One of My Sons.&quot; In truth, this phrase, found on a bit of paper and pointing directly to the criminal, was really part of the line, &quot;None of my Sons.&quot; It may be seen at a glance how the intent and the evidence of this line are purposely contradictory. The detective story is essentially dramatic, and therefore picturesque incidents and sensational situations are not only permissible, but advisable. The trained reader has learned to expect them. But unless they can be novel or original, there must be a skillful handling of the old devices. Likewise, there are certain stage properties with the use of which the author should be entirely familiar, and which he should be able to employ with grace and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weapon, the Papers, the Jewels, the Safe, the Alibi, are all his rightful belongings. So, too, the Lens, the Desk Blotter, the Waste Basket, the Cabman, the Deserted Wing, the Inquest, and the Mistaken Identity,—all are his, to manipulate at his pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he can afford to ignore such as these, and use The Monkey's Paw, or The Speckled Band, so much the better for his originality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-use-of-coincidences&quot;&gt;The Use of Coincidences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An error into which the beginning author easily falls is the too lavish use of coincidences. While perhaps the majority of detective stories are founded upon coincidences, they must be made so plausible, so seemingly inevitable, that they shall not appear to be mere coincidences. A modern fiction detective thus frankly admits the value of coincidences in his work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't forget the fortunate coincidences,&quot; replied Average Jones modestly. &quot;They're about half of it. In fact, detective work, for all that is said on the other side, is mostly the ability to recognize and connect coincidences.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reader cannot agree that a frankly announced coincidence makes as good a mystery problem as one where that element is left out. For instance in &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter,&quot; in his confession, the criminal relates: &quot;Like a fool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pouch, so obligingly, even necessarily, left on the table was of course the clue to the criminal. As a further coincidence this remarkable pouch bore the initials &quot;P.C.,&quot; which quite conveniently pointed to a suspect named Peter Carey, as well as to the real criminal, Patrick Cairns. This being discovered, Sherlock Holmes says naively, &quot;I was convinced that the initials P.C. upon the pouch were a coincidence and not those of Peter Carey, since he seldom smoked and no pipe was found in his cabin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this shows too clearly the author's dependence on a coincidence. In the completed structure the literary architect should not let his framework show, for it dispels illusion and either prevents or mars surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the whole question of coincidence is too deep and too really scientific to attempt its discussion here. Poe knew it to its last and finest degree, but not every one could follow its ramifications with the accuracy of his peculiar mind. He says in one instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it) happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities: that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustrations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the theory of probabilities is too abstruse for any but scholars, a general knowledge of the relative values of coincidences is most useful to the writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe says further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. Such sentiments—for the half credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought—are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The avenues of thought opened to our minds by these suggestions are fascinatingly attractive, and could we study the matter seriously it would soon put an end to many widespread fallacies of coincidence—such as receiving a letter from a friend one has been thinking of and ascribing it to telepathy—and like matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau appreciated the futility of depending upon the coincidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't forget,&quot; replied Lecoq, &quot;that the field of conjecture is boundless. Imagine whatever complication you like, I am ready to maintain that such a complication has occurred or will present itself some day. Lieuben, a German lunatic, bet that he would succeed in turning up a pack of cards in a certain order stated in a written agreement. He turned and turned ten hours per day for twenty years. He had repeated the operation 4,246,028 times when he succeeded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But leaving aside these deeper doctrines, let us use coincidence when necessary, carefully veiling it, however, with plausibility. Work up to the coincidence until it seems to occur naturally. Invent causes to produce the effects that otherwise would have seemed pure coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-use-of-melodrama&quot;&gt;The Use of Melodrama&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fault to be avoided is the use of melodramatic speech or incident. The day is past when readers are thrilled by the sort of diction that charmed Pomona of &quot;Rudder Grange,&quot; as she read aloud, &quot;Ha—Ha—Lord—Marmont—thundered—thou—too—shalt—suffer!&quot; And yet, in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; we read: '&quot;And the papers?1 asked the king, hoarsely; 'all is lost!&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to discover a loss of &quot;the papers&quot; without melodramatic exclamation; but moderate the speech of your characters at the time of the appalling discovery as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid, too, the use of sentiment. Romance is not now referred to; but other sentiments which though acceptable in the &quot;story of manners,&quot; tend to distract the reader of detective fiction. This field recognizes few emotions and no moral; and as a human document it depends for its success upon the primitive instincts of mankind and the material indications thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dullness&quot;&gt;Dullness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid dull and prosy description. If any type of story depends on action and excitement, it is the type we are discussing. Keep before you always the question of your reader's attitude towards your work. Arrest their attention, rouse their curiosity, awake their interest, and you have made your start. Continue to stimulate all these to the highest pitch, and your story is written. Let your final explanation more than satisfy their anticipation, and you have made a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build everything toward the final climax, using minor surprises as stepping-stones by the way. Continually produce the unexpected Persistently lead the reader to believe one thing and then suddenly convince him that he ought to have known it was another! Use every art and craft that in you lies to mislead him, but in such a way that when he is turned back to the right path he will vow he misled himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the two great principles: to have your facts as straight and true as a mathematical proposition; and to have your fancies as fascinating and elusive as a fairy tale. In a word, the ideal writer of detective fiction should be the child of Euclid and Scheherazade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-plots-and-their-solubility&quot;&gt;Unique Plots and Their Solubility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disdaining or tiring of the regulation plot some writers have branched off into erratic forms. This may be done with wonderfully fine effect if done perfectly. But only a genius, and an experienced one at that, should attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most brilliant achievement of this sort is Zangwill's &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot; As this book is now out of print, it may be well to state briefly its plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widowed landlady, a Mrs. Drabdump, after repeated knock- ings on the bolted bedroom door of her lodger, Arthur Constant, fails to awaken him. Terrified by vague fears of tragedy, she rushes across the street to implore the help of a neighbor, Mr. Grodman. He returns with her, and together they break in the bolted door of Constant's bedroom. A horrible sight meets Mrs. Drabdump's eyes, as she discovers the young man dead in his bed with his throat cut from ear to ear. Both windows are fastened; the door, until burst in, was both locked and bolted; and there is no other opening in the room. Add to this the fact that no razor or weapon of any sort can be found, and the problem seems insoluble. What is probably the best jury scene in fiction concludes logically that since the room could not have been entered by any intruder it could not be murder and must be suicide. It also concludes logically that since no weapon is found and the doctors declare that the wound could not have been self-inflicted, it could not be suicide and must be murder! This ingenious deadlock forms the nucleus of the story which is elaborated with cunning skill and marvelous subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most experienced reader is not prepared for the surprising denouement, which shows that the murder was committed by Mr. Grodman, after he broke open the door, and had been deliberately planned for by him, beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stated thus barely, the plot seems incredible; but as written by Mr. Zangwill, it is plausible, convincing, and intensely interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all. Detective Stories depend upon the ingenuity of the author—in the best, intellect is paramount. Characters, judged by other standards, may seem unreal without disturbing the reader's equanimity, provided the chain of causation is kept logically perfect. The disregard of this axiom has resulted in many failures. Gaboriau, not content to write a mere tale of mystery, tried to convert it into a well-rounded novel. But the most notable recent instance of the thing was the endeavor of Gaston Leroux in &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black,11 the sequel to &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room.&quot; Without knowing quite why, readers found their interest in it flagging. In some respects it is the subtlest story of its kind. The shifting semi- tropical atmosphere is finely caught and ought a priori to add intensity to the central mystery of doubtful identity. The mystery itself is developed with rare psychological insight, and the relation between a mother and son is so acutely defined as to make a certain noticeable halt in the process of detection seem perfectly natural. Yet impatience with the story is inevitable. From habit the reader holds his attention in readiness for running down a crime—for that and nothing more—and his mind relaxes when outlying material is brought in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harry Thurston Peck says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The indispensable condition of a good mystery is that it should be able and unable to be solved by the reader, and that the writer's solution should satisfy. Many a mystery runs on breathlessly enough till the denouement is reached, only to leave the reader with the sense of having been robbed of his breath under false pretences. And not only must the solution be adequate, but all its data must be given in the body of the story. The author must not suddenly spring a new person or a new circumstance upon the reader at the end. Thus, if a friend were to ask me to guess who dined with him yesterday, it would be fatuous if he had in mind somebody of whom he knew I had never heard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of all else, it is the mystery that arouses curiosity to the pitch of demanding explanation that counts. By few has it been played with a skill like that of Wilkie Collins, who, with little characterization or sentiment, without creating individuals of fiction whom we remember, or whose sayings we quote, could hold the attention of the novel-reading world with his &quot;Woman in White,&quot; or set them eagerly agog to find the whereabouts of the mysterious diamond taken from its Eastern sanctuary. For ingenuity of construction, blind leads, bafflings, and sustained interest &quot;The Moonstone&quot; stands high in the catalogue of the mysteries of fiction; and the reader was penetrating to a degree who fastened upon Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite the theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;women-as-writers-of-detective-stories&quot;&gt;Women as Writers of Detective Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a few among the best writers of detective fiction are women. That perspicacious critic, Julian Hawthorne, observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have often marvelled that women so seldom attempt this form of literature; many of them possess a good constructive faculty, and their love of detail and of mystery is notorious. Perhaps they are too fond of sentiment; and sentiment must be handled with caution in riddle stories.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a contemporary English essayist thus compliments our foremost American detective story writer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It may seem curious that women should be successful in a branch of fiction which many would be disposed to pronounce a masculine specialty. Perhaps Mrs. Green has herself supplied the explanation. In one of her best stories, 'That Affair Next Door,1 she introduces us to a very commonplace old maid, like most old maids curious, secretive, keenly observant of her neighbours' affairs, and fond of speculating about other people's business. Circumstances throw her into the very centre of a mysterious crime, and suddenly reveal in her all the qualities of a great detective. All the characteristics which made her a nuisance to her neighbours make her an invaluable ally to the police. The conception is a daring, and, I think, a true one. I fancy that the two faculties which the great Sherlock declared to be the prime necessities of a detective, observation and deduction, are feminine rather than masculine faculties. It will hardly be disputed that it is so in regard to the former; while, as to the latter, what man ever discovered as much about the inhabitants of the house opposite as any woman will deduce from the shape of their window blinds. Most women quite habitually indulge in the sort of ratiocination that Holmes practiced over the old hat. Be that as it may, Mrs. A.K. Green herself has certainly as much right as any contemporary writer to claim the mantle of Gaboriau for stories the excellent technique of which should put some popular writers on this side of the Atlantic to shame.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green, who is Mrs. Charles Rohlfs in real life, is far and away the best in our home field. She is entirely conversant with all the rules of detective fiction, and her long list of books stands alone on the top shelf. She, herself, tells an amusing story in connection with her first book, the celebrated &quot;Leavenworth Case.&quot; She wrote this story when quite young; and, becoming absorbed in the work, wrote wherever she happened to be, using any kind of stationery that might be at hand, from finest letter paper to backs of old envelopes or torn out ledger leaves. Unheeding the growing length of her story, she kept on until she had every drawer of an old bureau overflowing with its manuscript. Concluding at last, she stuffed all her papers into a large suit-case, and sallied forth to a publisher. The first publisher she called upon eagerly accepted the story; but to her regret, the young author was obliged to cut out more than forty thousand words of her manuscript. But the result was the most popular and the best-written detective novel by an American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other feminine authors have succeeded in this field. Mary E. Wilkins' short-story, &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; conforms to all the conditions required by the unwritten law. Natalie Lincoln, in &quot;The Trevor Case,&quot; and Mary Roberts Rinehart, in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; have done admirable work, as has also Stella M. During in &quot;Love's Privilege.&quot; &quot;That Mainwaring Affair,&quot; by A.M. Barbour, is among the masterpieces of construction, and Florence Warden may be accounted among the best authors of mystery stories in England. The series of short-stories by Baroness d'Orczy, and Augusta Groner, are as clever as any written by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of whatever sex the writer, or of whatever manner or style the setting, the one end and aim of the author must be curiosity aroused, increased and gratified. Other stories, other manners; but the Detective Story depends solely on this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ever remember Mr. Zangwill's dictum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The mystery-story is just the one species of story that can not be told impromptu or altered at the last moment, seeing that it demands the most careful piecing together and the most elaborate dove-tailing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
