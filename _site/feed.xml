&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;you-kill-me&quot;&gt;You Kill Me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orchestra gave him a couple of bars, for an introduction, and he stood there, still a little uncomfortable under the staring eyes of the TV cameras and a dozen assorted studio technicians, and gave out with his rich baritone on an oldie, something called Careless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sang with feeling. Professionally, he now called himself Burton, Buddy Burton, but he had been born plain Joe Caterisano, in a brick row house on the outskirts of Newark, NJ. His Latin blood showed in his raven black hair, in his slightly overripe but wholly natural gestures, as he punched emphasis into the worn-out words of the old song lyric. He was swarthily, masculinely handsome, and he sang, people said, like a bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You kill me,” a girl had told him at a party, a few evenings ago. “I don’t know what you’ve got, but every time I hear you sing something inside of me starts to flutter and then I just go all to pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll settle for that inside flutter,” he had gagged. “I don’t want to kill anybody, Miss Barney.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wished everyone well. The world, of late, had been a wonderful place to be in, from his personal standpoint. After he’d knocked them dead in the three nightclub bookings, his agent, Max Gittman, had got him this spot on TV, a fifteen-minute, three-nights-a-week summer sustain-er, and now things were coming his way so fast he was dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kid, you’re a shoo-in,” Max had told him. “Ever since you chucked that library of Como, Clark, Crosby and Sinatra in the ashcan, and started being plain Joe Caterisano—er, excuse me, Buddy Burton, that is —I could smell success on you. I mean strong, kid. Like garlic. I’ll make a prediction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What, Max?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Two years from now,” Max said, “you’ll be so fat you won’t know what to do with your money. You’re on the way, kid, and all roads lead up, in a hurry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrapped up his smooth rendition of Careless, giving it that characteristic Buddy Burton punch at the end, and a few seconds later the big red hand moved past the hour, and be could relax once more. The hungry eyes of the TV cameras no longer gobbled up each small derail of his face and figure for projection into millions of homes throughout the eastern half of the nation served by this TV network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rode the elevator down to the studio garage, and drove his car downtown and through the Tunnel, and an hour later be was relaxing in the living room of his modest house in the Jersey suburbs, listening to Marie tell him how she bad reacted to his broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t pick out anything to criticize, Joe,” she said seriously, a little loving frown on her pretty face, for she knew how he hungered for any small criticism which might help him improve on his performance. “You put those three songs over perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come on, baby,” be pleaded. “There must’ve been something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what,” she said. “Even when you were talking with the announcer, you seemed—just natural. Like it wasn’t something somebody had written down for you to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was perfect then?” Joe kidded. “Better watch out baby. I’ll be getting swell-headed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No you won’t,” Marie said, and she smiled, a small and warm movement of her pretty lips. “You’re too sensible for that, Joe. You worked eight years for this and you’re thirty years old, a man with a wife and three children, and a sense of humor about things. I guess I know my husband by now, Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she kissed him fondly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-note&quot;&gt;A Note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They went up to bed and at eleven-thirty, the phone rang. Joe threw a robe over pajamas and padded downstairs in bare feet to see what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Burton?” the voice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is Buddy Burton.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You stink, Burton. I caught you on the TV tonight, and you stink.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had only just begun to be somebody, but he bad always known that once he got there he would have cranks to contend with. He couldn’t help grinning, remembering what he’d said to Marie about getting stuck on himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much danger of that, with characters around like this one on the other end of the wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You may have something there, pal. Anything else on your mind? If not, I’ll go back to bed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put that voice or whatever you call it in mothballs, Burton. Go back to driving a truck for a living.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not till I have to,” he laughed, trying to keep this exchange on a good-natured level. “There’s more dough in the singing than in truck driving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get off the TV, Burton,” the voice gritted. “That’s a warning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone clicked dead and he stood there frowning at it for a moment before he replaced it in its cradle. Upstairs, Marie said sleepily, “Who was it, honey?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just some squawk,” Joe said. “Wanted to tell me I can’t sing worth a damn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie’s eyes opened, showing fright for a moment, and he said comfortingly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Guess we’re really on our way now, baby. Max Gittman says you can tell you’re beginning to get there when people start pestering you this way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie was up earlier than he, because of the kids. She went down and brought the milk in, and promptly ran upstairs to show him a note that had been thrust under the kitchen door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been fashioned out of words and letters snipped from the New York newspapers. It said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET OUT OF TV, KID. BIG MONEY AIN’T WORTH IT. HOW MUCH DOUGH CAN YOU SPEND SIX FEET UNDER?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m scared,” Marie said. Her eyes were wide, under the dark lashes, and her mouth trembled. “What are we going to do, Joe?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just some nut,” Joe said. “Some—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t dismiss it like that, Toe. This is a threat on your life. Take it to the police. Please?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He frowned at the prospect, but looking at Marie, sensing her fear for his safety, he knew he had no real choice in the matter…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;whaddaya-want-me-to-do&quot;&gt;Whaddaya Want Me To Do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under the kitchen door, hey?” the Chief of Police said. He bit the end off a stogie and stared hard at Joe across the tip of it, before striking his match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I been seeing you on my television, kid. You sing pretty. On your way, I’d say. Maybe another Sinatra.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you,” Joe said, and his cheeks reddened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now,” said the chief, “lemme get this thing straight. A guy phones you last night, tells you you stink as a crooner, and tells you to go back driving a truck, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s right,” Joe nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You laugh him off, so this a.m. the wife finds the note. All right, now whaddaya want me to do, Burton?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know your business, Chief. What’s your usual—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Usually, in a case like this, we’d turn the story over to the newspaper and the publicity, plus the information we’re holding ourselves responsible for your personal safety, would be enough to scare whoever put that note under your door back in his rat hole.” The chief blew cigar smoke at him, and frowned thoughtfully through it. “But somehow I ain’t worried about your safety, Burton.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What does that mean?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Judging from the way you’re coming along as a crooner, I’d say you got a smart business manager. Right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Right. Max Gittman.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give Max Gittman a message for me, will you, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What message?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell him my police department is gettin’ tired of bein’ the Patsy for every young Tom, Dick and Harry in show business that wants to stir up a fuss and get his name splashed around in the papers, complete with a picture showing his best profile to his public.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You think this is just a publicity stunt,” Joe said woodenly. “But it—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get outta here, Burton. I’m gonna tell you something. I got three girls home that are coming the dangerous age, and I don’t like crooners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I give you enough time already. Get out. Tell that Gittman what I said. You want publicity, you go out and earn it. Go overseas and entertain some of the boys that are fighting to keep this country safe for you crooners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I did my share of that,” Joe protested hotly. “I spent three years as a dogface, back in—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t cry on me, Burton. I lost two boys over there in the last one. Now get outta here, before I lose my temper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;this-is-a-stick-up&quot;&gt;This Is A Stick-Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He drove in Tuesday afternoon to rehearse for that evening’s slow, and Alec Thornbush, the program director, remarked that he seemed nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s nothing,” Joe told him. “Been off my feed the last day or two, Alec.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got through the show better than he had hoped to, rising to the occasion like any seasoned campaigner, but he hurried down to get his car, when it was over. In the back of his mind was a nameless worry; somehow he was eager to be home again, to know that Marie and the kids were okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he nosed the car out to the street, he had to wait for the light to change at the corner. A man in a light tan topcoat, wearing a felt bat pulled low over his eyes, stepped casually up to the car, on the passenger side, opened the door, and slid in beside Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe felt a tightness in his throat as he peered toward the intruder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry,” he said, underplaying his role. “No riders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess you said that a lot back when you were wheeling a truck for a living, didn’t you, Caterisano? This is a gun in my pocket.” He jabbed it through the tan cloth of the coat, stretching the cloth out to a little cone against the gun’s muzzle, so Joe could get the idea. “Drive,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe saw that the street was momentarily clear and he swung out from the garage, heading toward the Avenue of the Americas. “This is a stick-up,” he suggested hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You recognized me. You want my money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Drive,” the man said. He kept his face averted. He had on thick-lensed glasses. His coat lapels were turned up, hiding his chin and partly concealing his mouth.“And don’t do anything I might not like, pal. You just did another TV show, Caterisano. After I asked you not to. You get me kind of mad, pal. I don’t know what I’m goin’ to do with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s this all about?” Joe said angrily. “I never saw you before, friend. Why should you have it in for me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Another thing,” the man said. “You went to the cops, after I left that note under the kitchen door.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I happen to know you did. Because I tailed you. You made me plenty mad, pal. What did the cops say?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man not only talked mad, he looked mad. The gun again made a cone-shaped bulge against, the pocket of the tan topcoat, and, like a dog, the man seemed to be bristling with anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They laughed at me,” Joe tried to mollify him. “They seemed to think I was gunning for some free publicity at their expense, if yon must know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know something?” the man laughed. “I can believe that. I don’t think you’re lying.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s your angle?” Joe said. “What do you want of me? I don’t—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pull up to the curb down there in the next block, Caterisano, and turn off that ignition. We’ll talk a little.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-5&quot;&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;mr-x&quot;&gt;Mr. X.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe parked at the curb and turned for a better look at his rider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man said, “Uh-unh. Yon keep staring straight ahead, through the windshield. Now, you asked what I want, and I’ve already told you, but I’m ready to give you one more chance, pal. I want you to quit singing. Get oat of show business, see? Find some other way to earn a living, pal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I worked hard for the break I’m finally getting,” Joe said. “What are you, some kind of a nut? You don’t know what you’re asking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m telling, not asking. Get out of show business, Caterisano, or—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll kill you,” the man said in a matter-of-fact tone of voice that sent a sharp chill up Joe’s backbone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why?” Joe said. “Be reasonable. I’m entitled to at least some explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll give you some explanation,” the man said. “I’m a guy who never took to working for a living, pal. The way I get mine is my own business, see? And let’s say the cops would like to make it their business, but I’m just a little too smart for them. Get the idea?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“More or less.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never been mugged. I’ve never been printed,” the man said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t pull off many jobs, and when I do pull one off, I make it a big one. I operate solo. I trust nobody. I never go after anything but the hard cash. Jewelry has a way of fingering a guy, sooner or later. I won’t have anything to do with it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe said, “I guess I’m not very bright. What does all this have to do with my getting out of show business?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So far I’m an anonymous,” the man said. “I’m Mr. X. Oh, I been seen by a few people. But you know, it’s kind of funny how little help that is to the cops, pal. A guy walks into a place and holds it up, let’s say, for a couple of thousand, and gets away clean. So the guy on the unhappy end of the stickup goes to the cops and gives his description of the man, and what’s it add up to? Tall, dark, maybe handsome, dressed in this or that color suit. So what of it? What are the bulls going to do with it? Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a gimmick here somewhere,” Joe said wearily, “I still don’t get it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry about it,” the man said. “Start the car. Get it rolling. When we get down to that next stoplight, I’ll be getting out, pal. And you’ll keep on rolling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see,” Joe said and it did not occur to him to disobey the man’s curt instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One thought I’m goin’ to leave with you, pal. Get out of show business. Break clean, see? One more TV show, like tonight, and I’m goin’ to have to do for you. You can make your own choice, pal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe had come by now to the stoplight. It was red. He pulled up, waiting. The man opened the door and stepped onto the paving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just drive on when the light changes,” he said. “Don’t look back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light changed. Joe started the car, started across the intersection, and pivoted on the seat for a quick look at his man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bright headlights from the oncoming traffic flickered momentarily across the man’s face, spotlighting him, half-blinding him for one instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Caterisano got a very good look at the man, despite the lowered hat brim, the turned-up lapels of the coat, the eyeglasses. A sharp pulse of surprise slid through his tense body as he drove the big car down the street, and he said softly, “Well, I’ll be damned. So that’s his angle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-6&quot;&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;i-aint-buying&quot;&gt;I Ain’t Buying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief of Police stared at Joe across the glowing tip of a mangled cigar and said, “I checked that claim of yours, that you put in a couple years as a dogface in the war, kid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Three years,” Joe said. “Not a couple. I was at the Normandy beachhead, and in the Bulge, and—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And in a psycho ward for a couple months, after, accordin’ to my information,” the chief said. He scowled at Joe, obviously still not liking what he saw, still disapproving the way Joe earned his living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe you’re havin’ a relapse,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tell you, the guy means to kill me,” Joe said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw his face. He’s a dead ringer for me, Chief. I’m sure of it, even if he did have on those cheaters. Are you such a knucklehead that you can’t see why he’s scared?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kid,” growled the chief, big shoulders bunching up within the confining blue uniform coat, “you better go easy. You ain’t that big a shot yet, you can talk to me that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look,” Joe said wearily, “suppose I was a big shot. Like say, Sinatra. A big enough shot so that everybody, well, practically everybody, knew what I look like. And this guy happens to be a dead ringer for me. So what happens, the next time he tries to pull off a job, Chief?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Somebody gets a good look at him. Ordinarily they couldn’t describe him, except in a general way. But this time—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’d say,” cut in the chief, “he looks just like Buddy Burton, the famous crooner on TV and in the movies. Is that what you’re selling me, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what I’m selling. A couple more months on TV and I’ll be fingering this guy. And he knows it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief stared ruminatively at him through a cloud of cigar smoke. “This is like something out of a crummy paper-back, cops-and-robbers story. Go back and tell your friend Gittman, or whoever dreamed up this one, that I ain’t buying. I still ain’t handing you any free publicity, kid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is on the level,” Joe protested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, sure,” the chief scoffed. “Go on. Get outta here, kid. You told your story. I listened, but only because I’m paid to listen to stories. But I ain’t paid to believe ‘em. And I still don’t like crooners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want a police guard when I put my next TV show on,” Joe said insistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You want publicity, kid. Go buy yourself some. You’re makin’ money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief sat there, grinning impudently at him, still mangling the fat stogie between his wide lips. Joe threw up his shoulders in a tired gesture, and walked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-show-must-go-on&quot;&gt;The Show Must Go On&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hadn’t told Marie anything, but she noticed. That tension was in him, working away all the time, making its presence felt in small signs that reached the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Joe what’s wrong?” she said. “What’s the matter?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Joe, were you threatened again? Did that man—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Honey, everything’s all right. Honest. Now, don’t you worry your pretty little head over nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got his gun out of mothballs, the one he’d picked up on the other side, during his Army service, and he took it down to the studio, had it in his coat pocket as he rehearsed the new show for that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ate his light dinner in the luncheonette down on the street level, with Alec Thornbush. He kept looking around, as he nibbled at the food, and Alec said shrewdly, “What’s eating you, pal? What’s with this hunted man act?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I dunno. Working too hard, I guess. Just nerves, Alec”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That satisfied Alec They got up and Alec picked up the check for both of them, and walked toward the cashier’s cage with it Joe tarried to leave a tip, got up, and almost bumped into a man with a bat pulled down over his forehead, wearing glasses, a man who bore a striking resemblance to Buddy Burton, of TV fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello,” Joe said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get sick,” the man suggested. “Throw up or something. Don’t go on tonight, pal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m show folk. There’s a tradition. The show must go on,” Joe said slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll stick around,” the man said. “I’ll be right here, in the building. I guess you know how things stand, pal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who was that?” Alec asked, as Joe joined him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just a guy, Alec.” Joe glanced at his watch. “Getting toward show time. Let’s get up there”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clock in the studio said a quarter of the hour. Joe Caterisano, or Buddy Burton, faced the TV cameras and exchanged a few lines of banter with the announcer, Ben Barlow, and with Kitty Anderson, his feminine guest star. He sang a song and the studio audience, the far greater audience watching his image on TV sets throughout the city, noticed a strangeness in his manner as he sang this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was obviously tense. His gestures were jerky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the big red hand moved past the hour and the fifteen-minute show was over, Joe suddenly turned to Ben Barlow, and snapped, “You think you’re pretty smart, don’t you Ben?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portly announcer stared at him. “What’s the matter with you, kid? Are you nuts?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You loused me up on my lines,” Joe gritted at the startled announcer. I’m wise to you, Ben. Tryin’ to make me look bad. I’m onto your game. You never did like me, did you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kid,” Ben Barlow said smoothly, trying to put a pudgy hand across Joe’s shoulders and steer him off stage, away from the startled eyes of the studio audience, “you’re kind of mixed up. You—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Take your hands off me!” Joe said. He had the gun out of his pocket. “I don’t like you either, Ben. You know why?” he said, pointing the gun right at the popeyed announcer. “You look like a Kraut. That’s what you look like to me, a Kraut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kid, kid,” Barlow said weakly. “Take it easy. You’re upset. You—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shut up,” Joe said. He heard stealthy footsteps behind him and wheeled to see Alec Thornbush sneaking up on him. “Back off,” Joe grated, “before I have to plug somebody with this thing. It’s been a long time, but I guess I still have the knack of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec Thornbush stood still, not breathing. He appeared to have lost all desire to play the hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-8&quot;&gt;Chapter 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;running&quot;&gt;Running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe half-ran from the television stage, brandishing the gun with the air of a man who itched to kill somebody with it. He raced toward the hallway. The receptionist stared at him. She wore glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why, Mr. Burton—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Baby, give me those glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The glasses, baby. The glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He let her see the gun. She seemed to freeze for a moment. Slowly, like a person confronting a deadly snake, she slipped the glasses off and handed them to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way out of the reception room he paused beside a coat-and-hat rack long enough to appropriate a tan coat and a tan hat to match it. He ran out into the hallway just as Jimmy stopped at that floor with the number five elevator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man started to step out, but backed up quickly, staring at the gun Joe brandished. Joe followed him into the elevator, pointed the gun at Jimmy, and said, “Take her down a floor or two, kid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey,” the kid gulped. “What kind of a gag is this, Mr. Burton? That thing looks real. Quit pointing it—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go down a floor or two Jimmy. Nice and easy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You heard me all right, didn’t you, Jimmy?” Joe asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy looked at the gun. Jimmy said, “Yes, sir. Okay, Mr. Burton. Down, nice and easy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look here,” snapped the man Joe had backed into the elevator, “you can’t—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a portly, red-faced man with an officious manner. Joe pointed the gun at him and said, “Shut up, please.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man gulped. His mouth closed and he was sullenly silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop here, between floors,” Joe suggested. “We’ll sit awhile, Jimmy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Mr. Burton,” the kid said placatingly. He stopped and they stood quietly in the motionless elevator for perhaps three minutes. The portly man’s face grew increasingly sullen, but he didn’t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right,” Joe said. “Street level, Jimmy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kid took him down. He walked out into the tiled corridor, with the glasses in place over his eyes, the hat brim turned down over his brow, the gun in his hand hidden under the topcoat he had borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-9&quot;&gt;Chapter 9&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-gun-in-his-hand&quot;&gt;A Gun In His Hand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man came over from the other side of the newsstand and stood nonchalantly beside him. Jimmy had hurriedly closed the door of the elevator behind Joe, taking his important passenger up where he’d intended to go in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man said, close to Joe’s ear, “Pal, you should’ve known better.” His voice was almost plaintive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s in my blood,” Joe said. “I just had to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s the gag with the glasses? And that hat you’re wearing. It don’t even fit you, pal…Walk, friend. I’m focused on you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re taking a chance, aren’t you?” Joe stalled, and he was wondering how long it would take them to get here. A phone call from up above there shouldn’t take more than a matter of seconds, and the cops had radios in all their prowl cars, didn’t they? A guy gone berserk, with a gun in his hand, should rate faster action than he seemed to be getting. “You can’t get away with this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Walk, pal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe I called in the cops. Maybe they’ve got the building staked out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Walk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe I don’t even walk. Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re makin’ me nervous, Caterisano. Walk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind them, an elevator’s doors opened, and passengers disgorged from it. “There he is,” somebody said, and some of the hardier souls edged carefully across the tiles toward Joe and his nameless companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which one?” somebody was gasping. “Which one is Burton?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pal,” the man hissed at Joe’s ear, “you been up to something. I—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first cop came in then. He must have been an excitable rookie. He came barging in with his gun out, just asking for trouble from an armed man gone berserk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man at Joe’s side swore gutterally and shot through his coat pocket. The cop groaned and went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe knew he was almost certainly next in line for it, and he acted upon instincts developed during his hitch in the Army. He shot the man, his gun still hidden under the topcoat draped over his right arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hit his man in the chest, mindful of the crowd in the corridor, of the very real danger to all those present. The man went down like a stone, coughing and gasping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe kicked the gun out of his fingers, dropped his own gun, and the tan coat he had used to conceal its presence, and lifted his hands high as more of the cops spilled into the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;thanks-for-the-publicity&quot;&gt;Thanks For The Publicity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right,” the chief said, disgruntled. “I guess I you an apology, kid. That dumb rookie, O’Hara, will live, and it could be he owes his life to you. The corpse could be your twin brother, so that proves you were telling me a straight story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who was he?” Joe asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“John Davis,” the chief sighed. “Accordin’ to the identification card in his wallet. We got nothing in our records to tab him, and that checks with the story you said he told you. One of those smarties. A top operator, but working alone. I guess you did the public a service when you plugged him,” the chief admitted, somewhat grudgingly, it seemed to Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But did you have to be so melodramatic about it? Where was the need of staging that nut act, up in the studio?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t listen to me,” Joe grinned. “I had to do something drastic. You put the bug in my bonnet, Chief. I really ought to thank you for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t thank me for nothing,” the chief snapped. “I still don’t like crooners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, thanks for the publicity, anyway,” Joe grinned. “I’ll get a big play from the papers, on this. And a sponsor, if I know the radio business. Be seeing you on your TV set, Chief.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned his back on the chief, who was muttering into the mangled stogie, and went out to his car. He drove pretty fast, on the way out to Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie would be waiting up, to hear all about it, and they always garbled things on those newscasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-avenger&quot;&gt;The Avenger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At two bells The Boy determined to commit murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was no swift decision. On the night the Libertine lifted anchor at Melbourne—and Black Michael flogged him with a rawhide lash— the desire to slay had been impregnated in him, a terrible sore whose putrefying poison daily seeped into his blood and brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite suddenly, standing there in the shadow of the longboat, he perceived the death of his soul. Black Michael was responsible. He had inoculated him with a dreadful serum of evil that wiped out the germs of his strength; had proceeded, while he was in this weakened condition, to loot his being of all finer instincts. For that Black Michael must die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The avenger. That was his role. Tonight he would become the champion of his slain self and write in crimson the final chapter of a bitter story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he stood there on the deck, swaying with the drunken pitch of the two-masted, square-rigged vessel, it all came back to him—came back for the millionth time, with a burning sharpness that made him visualize, as though etched with steel upon his brain, the lamp-lit Australian water-front, the slinking shadows along the quay; made him feel, as if experiencing again, the sickening emotions following the blow and the return to consciousness in the hold of the trading brig bound for eleven degrees south of the equator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Til break you yet, boy—I’ll grind you under my feet—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was Black Michael’s threat when he sought to resist the big-fisted, rum-loving skipper. Then followed the first flogging, stripped and lashed to the beam. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recollection of it was gall in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that life for him consisted chiefly of two things: the lash and rum —the whip to break his body, the liquor to break his brain. These were linked by labors so offensive, so repellent that he welcomed the hours of drunken sleep when for a brief while his senses were drowned in oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all this darkness there were two candles: the friendly attitude of the first mate and the queer companionship of the brig’s mascot, Kerachi, a Rajputana parrakeet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the vessel reached the white coral walls of Papeite, Black Michael demonstrated that he could keep a threat; The Boy was broken; the slender thread between strength and weakness snapped … like the string of a fine instrument struck by brutal hands; and when the Libertine cast moorings in the blue lagoon of the Tahitian capital he was still aboard, with a bruised body and a bruised mind, knowing in his tortured heart that some day, when the courage was given him, he would kill the master of the brig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tahiti the ship passed through the coral traps of Les Isles Dangereux, sailed around the low archipelago into the phosphorescent waters of the Marquesas … to Havana; and there, in Atuona Valley, he received the gift of courage—from The White Lotus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days ago—the one time he had gone ashore—he had seen her clinging to the doorframe of a thatched bamboo dwelling. “Old Babache’s kid … a leper,” he heard someone say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she had smiled at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour after that, when the longboat was putting away from the beach, and the tawny maidens of Hiva-oa ran out waist-deep in the green bay to wave farewell, she was there, her gold hair falling like glinting fire about her pale, spray-dashed face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ia ora na i te Atiia. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Marquesan girls she sang that farewell—this White Lotus that he had found dying in the mulch of the South Seas. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sight of her was to him a light that pierced his poisoned, vapor-clung brain. And because he had seen her, this pallid leper-child, he knew that the hour had arrived when the master of the Libertine must pay the penalty for having murdered his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet what would she think if she knew? But she would never know. Hiva-oa, dreaming its eternal dreams beneath the brooding thunders of Temetiu, had already slipped into the past—and in its dreams she lay, a part of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shuddered again. Yes, he would kill Black Michael. He was below in his bunk now—drunk, as usual. With the skipper gone, the first mate, Cardigan, would come into command—and then …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He crept across the wet deck and down the companionway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A door in the rear of the lazarette, which was just off the main cabin, admitted him to a passage amidships, beneath the deck, leading forward to a space in the fo’castle where he and five others of the crew bunked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bulkhead door he paused. A sooty slush-lamp, swung from the blackened beam, cast sluggish light upon six bunks arranged in double tiers along the bulkhead. It was a foul place, reeking of vile sea odors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the bunks were occupied. The lower tier of one supported the hulking body of a bullet-headed mulatto, clad only in short breeches, while above him lay the boatswain, a Creole from New Orleans. They were both asleep and breathing heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrusting the weapon under his belt, he retraced his steps along the passage amidships and in the gloom of the main cabin groped toward Black Michael’s quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A terrible fear laid frigid fingers upon his heart as he reached the door. For a full minute he stood transfixed to the spot, his breath caught in his throat; then he grasped the knob, turned it and the door swung open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within, the closed porthole—a pale eye of dread—stared at him. The air was close—tainted with rum and human flesh. He listened for the sound of breathing, but only the monotonous murmur of the bilge water and the creak of straining timbers could be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He drew the knife from beneath his belt—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leper child came to him then … a blinding flash of spiritual pallor, the shining recoil of his dead self that sprang through the darkness of his soul and smote him paralyzed for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Black Michael must die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me reached the bunk; looked down upon the indistinct, sprawling figure. A wave of hysteria swept him, swamping his courage. He wanted to run, to throw himself upon his mattress and weep out the sorrows that twisted his heart. But—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… A swing of the blade, a sickening sound … and it was finished. He never released his grip on the hilt; held it as though it were a member of his own body; withdrew it and fell against the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time he lay with his shoulders pressed to the panels, at bay, facing the specter of himself; but when at length the fear-paralysis released him, he burst out of the door, closed it, raced through the main cabin and up the companionway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air on deck seemed to lift from his brain the mantle of a loathsome vapor. Here in the tropic moisture of the night, where the wind swelled amongst the waving spars, his reason returned, swept over him like a cold and shuddersome flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He glanced fore and aft. The decks were deserted but- for a lone figure on the poop deck. The watch—he could recognize him—a form planted as a piece of statuary upon the wheel-grating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He slunk past the forward hatch and climbed the ladder to the fore-poop. A stinging spray, flung over the bowsprit by a long gust of wind, struck his face sharply. It seemed to awaken him to the fact that he still gripped the knife, and with a shudder of repulsion he let it fall to the deck planks. For an instant he stood above it, looking as one fascinated upon the glinting thing; then he touched “it with his bare foot … shivered … and pushed it across the deck until it disappeared over the bow….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sobbing breath was drawn from his throat. He turned and fled down- deck—as one pursued by the horrors of the nethermost hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching his quarters he found the mulatto and the Creole still asleep; the slush-lamp hung from the blackened beam, swaying with the heave of the brig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chill started him to trembling and he knelt beside his bunk, removing a flask from beneath the mattress. As he lifted it to his lips a sound behind him made him pause with it in mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get below, you dirty lubbers! … Bahdsoodai! …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned his head sharply. Neither the mulatto nor the Creole had altered his position—but perched upon the beam was a feathery green body. His rigid muscles relaxed as he recognized Kerachi, his friend, the Rajputana parrakeet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He raised the flask to his mouth. The vile Tahitian rum was like vitriol, searing a path from his throat to the pit of his stomach. It choked him, but when he ceased coughing he took another gulp—another. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Step lively, lads! … Adrushtam! … Two bells, mate!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two bells. Those words startled him. That was just before he—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shuddered; swallowed quantities of the liquid fire; drained the bottle and fell with his face buried in the reek of the mattress. The flask slipped from his nerveless hand—struck the floor with a distant thud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“O, God—” he moaned. Hot tears burned his cheeks as he lay there sobbing in the awful abandonment of drunken grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All hands aft!” shrieked the parrakeet, then began to swear in Hindustani and Mandarin. That was the last thing he heard, the grotesque profanity of the little bird. Like a barque severed from its mooring-lines, his brain was carried downstream on the current of slumber….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His labored breathing had hardly joined that of the other occupants of the foul place when the big mulatto sat up cautiously, a stealthy, anticipatory smile spreading over his negroid features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rose, the movement bringing into visible play the thick, heavy-corded muscles beneath the bared brown skin; stood an instant looking up at the sleeping boatswain; crept across to The Boy’s bunk and slipped one hand under the mattress …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;dead-about-an-hour&quot;&gt;Dead About An Hour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sharp cutwater of the Libertine broke the phosphorus into javelins of green brilliancy, her yards, slightly checked, ran with easy motions beneath bellied topsail, while the deck-timbers creaked and groaned as the vessel wallowed in the heavy sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Cardigan, the first mate, standing alone at the wheel, firmly gripping the spokes at right angles, these sounds blended into a fierce, savage tune that vibrated responsive chords in his seaman’s being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since six bells he had been on watch, listening to the lawless song of the sea, and except on two occasions, when the cabin boy emerged from the main companion, the decks had been deserted during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At thought of The Boy, the first mate felt a tinge of sympathy. Poor chap. Only seventeen. And shanghaied—but, after all, life was a rather grim affair; it had been none too kind to him. He—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four bells jangled out. A moment afterward he saw the big body of Bjornsen, the second mate, emerge from the rear companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’s the captain?” inquired Cardigan, as the Norwegian, a great hulk of sunburnt physical manhood, reached his side and took the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A faint smile traced itself on the big blonde’s face. “Below in his quarters, I suppose, sir—with a belly full of rum …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan did not smile, merely nodded, saying, “Stearns will relieve you,” and moved down the ladder to the main companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching Black Michael’s door he entered without knocking. In the vague half-light supplied by the porthole he could make out the skipper’s huge body sprawled full length in the berth. The odor of rum was heavy on the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Captain!” he called, gripping one shoulder and shaking it. “Captain, wake up! … Hullo!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter exclamation was brought forth as his hand accidentally brushed the cheek of the recumbent man! It was cold, clammy. He quickly felt the heart. An oath left his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He fumbled in the pocket of his pea-jacket and withdrew a box of matches. Igniting one he lit the slush-lamp and in the better light examined the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dead,” he muttered to himself with a semi-professional air. “Two incisions—one just below the heart, the other above. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Cardigan was not yet thirty-five, there were times when he seemed at least forty. This was such an occasion. About his lips was a grim tightness, a truculence that suggested inflexible metal beneath the bronzed exterior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Struck in the dark, I’ll wager,” he said to himself, running his fingers through his gray-shot hair whilst he continued his investigation. “Dead about an hour or I’m … And two distinctly different instruments, one a straight blade, the other curved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time he had studied surgery—in the days before the gray appeared in his hair. He … But that was an ancient story, a sheaf torn out of his life and laid away in a crevice of his memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first surprise caused by the discovery, he experienced a feeling that bordered on satisfaction. No love had ever existed between him and the master of the brig, and after The Boy was shanghaied at Melbourne there was open antagonism, a hostility that resulted in Cardigan’s decision to leave the Libertine at the end of the return voyage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Black Michael was dead, he mused, murdered—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture his eyes, involuntarily lowered, were captured by a bright object on the floor. He stooped, picked it up and perceived that it was a small, curved blade—a murderous Malay knife that bore ugly stains. As he recognized it he felt a shock like nothing short of a volt of electricity— for the weapon was his own, a relic of the days before the gray appeared among his dark hairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a slim, dark-eyed Malay girl, down on the drowsy shores of the Archipelago where the restless surf drums to the tune of lawless love, and … But that, too, was an ancient tale, laid away in lavender with the other poignant recollections. She had given him the knife, this brown maiden, as she lay dying in his arms, and it was the only tangible remembrance of a still smouldering passion… .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His face settled into sterner lines. This was undoubtedly the blade with which the incision was made. But how had it been obtained from his cabin and why was it used? The most logical answer for both was: treachery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His first impulse was to wipe the soiled blade upon his handkerchief, but he refrained, for Cardigan and discretion were synonymous. Bloodstains often proved incriminating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, innocent though he was, he decided, he dared leave no evidence where it might be discovered and used against him. This weapon was sufficient proof that he had an enemy aboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He first considered throwing the knife into the sea, but this proposed means of disposal he immediately dismissed; he would sooner separate himself from an arm than the weapon. He would hide it; there were many places on the ship where so small an object would never be found—and the place that appealed to him as one less frequented was the paint-locker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After covering the body with a sheet, he quitted the cabin, locked the door and made his way to the paint-locker. A moment later the Malay knife lay hidden behind a pile of cans and Cardigan went up on deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An impalpable mist was drifting in from the dark waste of waters, smoothing out the sharp lines of the Libertine and giving to her the look of a phantom craft as she rode the steadily increasing swell, her lights burning hazily, like nebula-belted planets in the fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the forward hatch Cardigan encountered Stearns, the midshipman, a sallow youth of twenty-one or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Go below and send the hands aft, Mr. Stearns,” the mate ordered, “every man Jack of them… Then he moved to the poop-deck where Bjornsen stood as one petrified at the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bjornsen,” he began, “the captain has been murdered, stabbed twice. I have sent for the crew to notify them. I’m in command now and I want your hearty support.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian nodded, his stolid face unaltered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later the crew was assembled below the poop, a nervous, shuffling crowd, looking up with uneasy eyes at the first mate. Scum of the Fast and West they were, washed together on the tides of the Seven Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are they all here, Mr. Steams?” inquired Cardigan of the midshipman, who was climbing to the poop-deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All but the cabin boy, sir; he’s down in the fo’c’s’le drunk as—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll see him later,” interposed the first mate. Then he cupped his hands about his mouth to make himself heard about the wind and sea. “Men, I’ll be brief. A crime has been committed aboard this brig. Just before six bells I was in the skipper’s quarters—and when I returned a few minutes ago I found him dead—murdered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He paused to observe the effect of this announcement upon the men. Rows of sullen eyes looked up at him—eyes in which there were mingled fear and questioning. What a ghastly lot they looked, huddled there in the mist, thought Cardigan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of you”—he made a sweeping gesture with his bronzed hand—“one of you killed him. And I’ve called you here to ask if the guilty man is willing to confess and thus lighten his punishment, or, in the event a confession isn’t forthcoming, if anyone knows anything that might be instrumental in locating the murderer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long silence England Charlie, third mate, a big, gaunt cockney, with a red face and red hands, spoke up: “You said one o’ us wus th’ murderer, sir, but ’ow d’ we know you didn’t croak ’im?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this there was a murmur from the men. Encouraged, the cockney continued. “You’d be th’ one to benefit by ’is snuffin’ it—an Hi arsks, ’ow d’ zve know you didn’t send ’im orf?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan met his gaze coolly and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re justified in saying that,” he admitted. “But I was at the wheel from six bells to four bells—and if any man aboard understands post mortem conditions he can examine the body and see that the skipper has been dead just about an hour—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But you could ’ave lashed th’ wheel,” persisted English Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan’s jaw shot forward at an ugly angle. “Are you trying to accuse me, Charlie?” he demanded. There came no reply and he went on, “More than ever I’m determined to leave nothing undone to find the man who killed the captain—and as a first step every one shall submit to a search for evidence—now. I’m in command here and I intend to assert my authority. Sykes, you and Stearns help me. Meanwhile, no one will leave the deck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Cardigan started to descend the ladder he heard a savage oath, and, pausing, fastened his eyes upon the men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did someone speak?” he rapped. Ladd, a seaman, answered—“Jim Hickey here said he’d be damned if he was searched—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a lie, sir!” broke in the bullet-headed mulatto, the great muscles in his arms standing out like whipcords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan moved down and confronted the mulatto. “Did you say that?” The boatswain, a Creole, stepped forward. “Eet ees so, m’sieur; I, ‘Poleon Moncrief, hear’ heem. W’at ees more” —he cast a malicious glance at the mulatto, who stood with clinched fists, glaring at him—“I know w’y zat nigger he not want to be search’. I was een my bunk trying to go to sleep w’en ze cabanne boy he come below an’ drink a dam’ lot of rum. An’ w’en ze boy he fall asleep zat nigger he sink I not ’wake an’ get up an’ go to ze bunk of ze cabanne boy an’—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blasphemous oath left the mulatto’s thick lips. He made a move to spring at the Creole, but Cardigan placed himself between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“—He steal ze cabanne boy’s pay. I saw heem take eet from under ze mattress. An’ zat w’y he not want to be search’, m’sieur—because he know you fin’ too much money on heem.” Cardigan turned upon the huge, brown-skinned figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is that the truth, Hickey? Aren’t you willing to be searched?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mulatto glared at ’Poleon Moncrief, spitting out a stream of vile oaths. “It’s a lie, sir; a damned, stinkin’ lie—made up by that—!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a quick, stealthy movement the Creole leaped around Cardigan and flung himself at the mulatto’s throat. Together they went to the deck, rolling upon the moist timbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Cardigan stooped to separate them the mulatto freed himself by a sudden wrench and gained his feet, dashing along the deck toward the forward companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mate started in pursuit, but halted as his eyes fell upon a belaying pin that lay upon the deck not many feet away. Hastily arming himself with this formidable missile, he sent it spinning through the air after the fleeing figure. It caught the negro in the back of the skull; knocked him flat upon the deck planks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan, followed by several of the crew, reached his side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s out for some time,” reported the first mate, bending over him. “Two of you lads carry him below and lock him up— But wait!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ran one hand into the rear pocket of the mulatto’s trousers, producing a black leather wallet. Opening it he withdrew a wad of bills, which he swiftly counted and returned to the wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled grimly. “All right, men; below with him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-thing&quot;&gt;The Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very midst of a dream The Boy was shot into consciousness. For a moment he could not remember where he was. He seemed to be caught in the teeth of a monster that shook him horribly, mercilessly. Half-remembered objects separated themselves from the chaos and he heard a distant voice pronouncing his name. Yet for some inexplicable reason he was unable to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually he extracted himself from the teeth of the monster; gradually objects settled into their regular places. Above him was a familiar face. As he recognized it sleep dropped from him as though severed by a blade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get up,” he heard Cardigan say, while he shook him vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boy lurched to his feet. As he brushed one hand across his lips he inhaled his breath, an odor that sickened him. Invisible hands seemed to jerk aside a drowsy fabric, revealing in their biting sharpness the incidents before his drunken sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His soul shrank, dwindled with fear. Black Michael’s body had been found and the mate had come to accuse him—But how did he find out? The only incriminating evidence, the knife, had been thrown into the sea… .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought you promised me never to do this again,” reproved Cardigan. “But we’ll discuss that later. Come with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boy was dreadfully afraid. The blood pounded in his temples, beat so loudly that it seemed to boom out his guilt. God! How could he meet Cardigan’s honest gaze—knowing in his heart that he had wielded the knife that finished Black Michael?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some manner—he knew not how—he forced himself to follow the mate along the passage amidships and when they reached the cabin his fear increased to a panic as he perceived that Cardigan was making directly for Black Michael’s quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stood with a rapidly pounding heart behind the mate while he inserted a key in the lock and turned it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within, the slush-lamp, turned low, threw quivering shadows upon the walls. The air was warm and unpleasantly heavy with the smell of stale rum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there in the bunk it lay, covered with a sheet—The Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan closed the door and turned the lamp higher. Mercy of God, thought The Boy, was he going to draw aside that sheet and …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boy,” commenced the man, halting beside the bunk. “I brought you here to show you this.” And he turned back the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something worse than horror reached up and clutched at The Boy’s throat. He half closed his eyes; dared not shut them entirely, for The Thing fascinated him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The captain has been murdered,” Cardigan continued. “A few minutes ago I happened on the fore-poop. I dropped a wallet and it fell overside— but fortunately caught in the projecting space under the bowsprit. And when I picked it up I found this with it—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He withdrew an object from the pocket of his pea-jacket. A cry leaped to The Boy’s lips—died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There before him, sharp and ugly in the flickering glow of the slush-lamp, was the knife with which he killed Black Michael!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now come here,” commanded the mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He obeyed, the cabin reeling dizzily about him. What use was there of trying to hide the truth now? Cardigan knew and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look,” was the sharp injunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he looked … at The Thing on the bunk. As he saw the exposed chest a shriek of sheer terror was wrung from his throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, no!” he cried. “I didn’t stab him twice—I didn’t! Only once, in the dark … and then I ran—” He shuddered. “O, God, what have I said?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a broken sob he sank to his knees, burying his face in his hands&amp;lt; An instant later fingers closed over his shoulders and lifted him to his feet— fingers that were not rough but firm and determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You said what I wanted to hear,” announced Cardigan. “Look at me, boy… . There … Now, I’m going to question you and I want the truth, the truth—before the God that you just called on… . When did you stab Black Michael?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A little after two bells, sir—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why? Because he had mistreated you? … How did you do it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I …” And there followed a stumbling, detached account of his movements from the time he left the deck until he surrendered to sleep in his bunk in the fo’castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s fortunate for you that I found the knife,” remarked Cardigan when he had finished, “for it has your initials upon the hilt. I saw you come on deck twice while I was at the wheel; one time you went near the bowsprit but not until after I found the knife did I attach any importance to it.” He paused, resuming after a moment. “It’s quite evident that two people stabbed the captain—you and an unknown person. But who stabbed him first? Who is the real murderer? These are skeins that must be untangled. All I require of you is a close mouth and an open&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then—then you’re not going to lock me in the brig?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are free: only remember my instructions—and regard them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boy stared at him. He was dazed, stunned. Instead of a blow he had received kindness. Kindness. New and loftier emotions stirred within him; he tried to speak, to utter words that would convey his gratitude to the mate; he could only stand and stare mutely. Nor was that dumb look, mirroring his deepest and most profound emotions, unobserved by Cardigan; it came to him as an illuminating signal-flash from The Boy’s soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now run along,” he said, not unkindly, opening the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In silence The Boy passed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he moved through the cabin, which was faintly lit by a hanging lamp, his brain groped in a labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some one else had sought to end Black Michael. Who was the owner of this other hand that had driven a blade into the skipper’s breast? And which of the two had accomplished his purpose, he or the unknown person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his agony he prayed that it was the other, for though a short while ago The White Lotus had seemed a lamp that lighted the way to this ghastly action, he now saw, with the cold clearness of returned sanity, that with blood upon his soul he was severed from even spiritual companionship with this pallid leper-child who had impressed herself so deeply upon his memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how could he ever find out? It all seemed very hopeless… .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he neared the fo’castle he saw a vertical strip of yellow light cleaving the dark passage from the bulkhead door. Voices within were murmuring in hushed conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was almost in the opening when a sentence, flung against his ears with the sting of a whip, cemented him to the spot: “I only struck once, I tell you, once—yet there are two wounds. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those words, spoken in a voice that was lowered to a tone just above a whisper, yet strangely familiar, brought forth his breath in a gasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He crept nearer the source of light; peered within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slush-lamp was turned low, casting flickering shadows as it swung with the motion of’ the brig. Five of the bunks were vacant; the sixth, near another bulkhead-door, opposite The Boy, was occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moncrief, the Creole, sat on the edge of the bunk, a cigarette between his thin, moist lips, and at his side, face and shoulders hidden by the boatswain’s slender body, was another man. That bunk was used by the Chinese cook, The Boy knew, yet the one who lay there was not the Oriental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were talking again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By gar, eet ees ghastly, m’sieur,” commented Moncrief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes—a ghastly failure,” spat out the other. “’Poleon”—a note of intensity came into the voice—“I see but one thing to do now. By four in the morning we should be near the coral reefs—they’re just a mile off course. Wajo, the Polynesian, will be at the wheel; we can overpower him—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sacre dam, m’sieur!” broke in the boatswain. “Do zat—zat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why not? To reach Tahiti means investigation by the authorities. If the brig goes down she carries all evidence with her. We can escape in the longboat; islands are numerous along here—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But, m’sieur, ze knife of ze first mate zat you lef’ in ze—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“God knows what became of it! When he found the body he must have hidden the damned thing—and if I knew where … But no; I’m afraid to try it now. The second wound is what has scared me off; it’s a sign to warn us.” Then he swore a volley of oaths so vile that they burned The Boy’s ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the captain killed,” went on the voice, after a moment^ “and the first mate disposed of by the incriminating evidence, we could have easily bought the crew over to us. With me in command we could have gone straight to Melbourne for the cargo of rum. McAllister would have paid well when we delivered it to him at Hiva-oa, for when his cursed natives have plenty of rum they do more work—and since the French government has restricted the— Oh, well, what’s the use to talk of it? You got the best of the deal; I had the dirty work of killing the swine. It was too big an undertaking for two men to try——”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But, m’sieur—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, ’Poleon; the only thing to do now is save ourselves. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pregnant dread was spreading through The Boy’s body, a sensation of abysmal emptiness. The coral reefs; the Polynesian. Then they intended to—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he could learn who stabbed Black Michael first! But did he want to know? Yes, the truth was far better than horrible uncertainty. Yet he dared not enter the fo’castle alone; he must go and bring Cardigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he turned to creep away a sudden plunge of the vessel sent him flat upon the deck of the passage with a sound that seemed loud enough to be heard from stem to stern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was almost on his feet when a lean figure appeared in the bulkhead door. Instantly he recognized Moncrief. He made a dive toward the lazarette, but the boatswain was too quick for him; he flung his lithe body upon him and bore him to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boy opened his lips to cry out and the Creole’s fist descended upon his mouth. The pain stung him to action. With a desperate wrench he freed himself and fell against the bulkhead, but before he could move a second figure was momentarily silhouetted upon the light in the oblong aperture—a figure that hurled itself upon him, pinning him to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again he tried to scream—again a fist bruised his lips horribly. He felt blood dripping from his chin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, don’t—” he cried, his mouth throbbing with pain. Something crashed down upon his skull and as he fell, plunging into what seemed a depthless abyss, a picture was photographed upon his brain—that of a dark, sinister figure silhouetted upon the glow in the bulkhead door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the world reeled, a drunken universe—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;off-the-course&quot;&gt;Off The Course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A knock on the door of his quarters brought Cardigan out of a light sleep. Sitting up on the edge of his bunk he called, “Come in!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening of the door admitted a wavering blade of light and in the frame, outlined upon the pale illumination from the main cabin, was a form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s Stearns, sir,” announced the man. “I’m sorry to wake you up, but I have something queer to report.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan rose. “Wait a second till I make a light.” Then a moment later when the slush-lamp cast its ill light upon his nearly-clad form he added, “All right, Stearns, what is it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midshipman’s sallow face seemed paler than ever; he shifted uneasily from one foot to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen something that I don’t quite understand, sir,” he began. “I had just been relieved by Wajo and was going toward the fo’castle when I happened to glance athwart the brig. I saw what looked like two shadows; then I realized they weren’t shadows but men—two of them, moving along the port deck. They disappeared behind the after-cabin as soon as I saw them, but I got the impression that they were carrying something—or—or someone. A minute later I could have sworn I heard a cry. It scared me a little, sir, after all that’s happened on this brig, so I hurried down in the fo’c’s’le. I didn’t know what to do— and after about an hour I decided to tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you did right,” commended Cardigan—for while the midshipman was telling his story something insidious had taken root in his brain, an alarming possibility that caused him no little apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m going on deck,” he announced, removing his pea-jacket and cap from a peg on the wall. “Return to your quarters and say nothing to the men of what you’ve seen. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He followed Stearns into the poorly- lighted main cabin, and as the midshipman reached the top of the companion- way, gripping the brass rail to keep from being hurled back by the dangerous roll of the vessel, the mate moved through the lazarette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midway in the dark passage leading into the fo’castle he collided with something that sprang away from him and swore lurid oaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who’s that?” demanded Cardigan. “Hinglish Charlie. ’Oo th’ blurry ’ell’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The first mate. Is the cabin boy in the fo’c’s’le?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, sir; Hi ayn’t seen ’im this evenin’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, help me look for him. You start at the bow and I’ll go aft.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together they passed through the main cabin and at the top of the companionway staggered out upon the deck, gripping the wet lee rail. Here they separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blanket of fog had been dropped from the dark sky and the peak-gutters snarled and roared as the heavy sea, dashed inboard, was sucked back again to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinging to the drenched rail the mate moved aft. Near the long-boat amidships, a human form darted suddenly around the corner of the aftercabin and ran into him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan was thrown roughly against the rail, and as he gained his balance the figure, head down, lurched past him toward the main companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who’s that?” he bellowed, hollowing his hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For answer the figure plunged on; gained the companion; vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan swore savagely. Moving across the slippery timbers, he reached the companionway and descended. Below, in the main cabin, the door of the lazarette gaped at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With quick strides he made his way toward the fo’castle. The passage was not dark this time, for during the interval that he was on deck a light had been made in the crew’s quarters and it sent a pale, trembling shaft through the bulkhead door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the entrance to the fo’castle Cardigan halted, an exclamation on his lips—for he stood face to face with English Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How the devil did you get here?” he demanded suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cockney indicated the entrance opposite the bulkhead door, through which opening the bottom of a flight of stairs was visible. “I came down the steps, sir. I just stopped a minute to make a light ’ere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought I sent you to find the cabin boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You did, sir—but Hi ayn’t found ’im yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan whirled about and at that moment a voice behind him shrieked: “Two bells, mate—two bells. …” The sound brought him around again and the cockney, grinning, pointed to a feathery green body perched on the upper tier of one of the bunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan swore as he made his way alone to the main cabin. Damn him, who was this fellow who had slunk past him on deck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lazarette door he paused to consult his watch. Ten minutes to four. From the timepiece his eyes rose to the compass in the deck-beam overhead. He could distinguish the tiny figures on the white disc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good God!” sprang from his lips. Who was on watch? Wajo—and the fool was headed off the course … toward where the coral traps lay—“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took a step to cross the main cabin and at that very instant—so exact is the time-table of Fate—a sudden titanic shock hurled him flat upon his back. The fall partially stunned him, and as he lay there trying to marshal his scattered faculties the bow of the vessel seemed to leap up, rolling him against the cabin bulkhead. Following that loose objects tumbled down; glass shattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a moment of struggle, Cardigan succeeded in getting to his feet. Finding himself in darkness, he realized that the lamp had been broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A splotch of misty light showed him the companionway, and, slipping and stumbling across the slanting floor, he groped his way to the foot of the stairs, where his outstretched hands found the brass rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ascended. On deck charging billows broke in white foam over the gunwale, sweeping angrily against the cabins and masthead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed a deathless period to Cardigan before he reached the break of the poop; here he gripped the ladder and looked over his shoulder at the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bow was thrust up into the throat of the fog, the stern so deeply sunk that the main-chains dipped, while a list to the port permitted the sea free entrance through a tear in the bulwarks. She had evidently struck with tremendous force; the forward mast was down and the deck, below the fore-poop, in splinters, where broken spars had crashed through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grasped the situation instantly, realizing the urgency of keeping a cool head. The bows were jammed between the rocks and at any moment the wounded ship might slide back off the reefs—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His teeth snapped shut and he climbed the ladder. As he stood upright on the poop-deck, peering into the mist that masked the remote end of the vessel, a vague shape slid across the timbels at him. Instantly he saw that it was a man and tried to steady himself for the encounter that he knew was unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the jar that he expected, a smashing blow was delivered full in his face, and with mingled surprise and pain he realized that it was an attack rather than a collision. The moment he hit the deck he was up again, sending his fist into a yielding paunch. The figure went down without a cry, doubled in a knot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment Cardigan stood above his antagonist, waiting for him to rise; then, believing him rendered breathless by the blow, he bent over to ascertain the identity. He had no sooner abandoned his guard than he regretted it, for the knotted form straightened out and sprang at him—but not too swiftly for him to see the swarthy face of ’Poleon Moncrief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So you’re the traitor aboard!” bellowed Cardigan. “You killed—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more they came together. This time they clinched; went to the slanting deck, rolling over and over until they struck the rail, where the force of the impact separated them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaping to his feet, Cardigan stood ready, and when the boatswain rose a well-aimed blow between the eyes sent him reeling against the gunwale. He crumpled up. The first mate bent swiftly and gripped him about the waist; lifted him and hurled him, clawing and kicking, overboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the body of Moncrief was swallowed by the fog Cardigan staggered back against the wheel. His heel encountered an object, and looking down he saw the Polynesian, Wajo, stretched out beside the wheel-grating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He dropped on his knees to examine the body, and at this juncture someone scrambled over the break of the poop, looming tall and sinister in the mist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Cardigan?” The voice belonged to Stearns. “The whole bow’s smashed—clear to the main hatch! Who in the name of—” He stopped as a roll of the vessel sent him sliding across the wet deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grip yourself, man!” cried Cardigan, rising and moving to his side. ‘‘Remember, you’re midshipman on this brig! … Let’s make for the longboat. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mate led the way from the poop to the long-boat, where a group of men, smears of dark animation in the fog, were struggling at the davits. English Charlie’s voice rose above the clamor as he sang out orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you find the cabin-boy, Charlie?” * asked Cardigan, reaching the cockney, who stood with a dripping tarpaulin thrown over his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, sir—an’ Hi looked from bow to stern!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor beggar, thought Cardigan. His fears were confirmed. The two figures Stearns had seen in the mist loomed as sinister elements in the fate of the cabin-boy; the cry seemed conclusive evidence that evil had befallen him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gripped himself and ordered: “Charlie, send two men below to fetch provisions and blankets—and have them step lively!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As two of the crew disappeared in the fog, headed for the companion, English Charlie drew himself into the life-boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything in shape?” queried Cardigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aye, aye, sir! Oars, mast, canvas and water!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is the rudder shipped properly? … Here come the provisions. In with them, men… . Get the lines clear and the boat ready to swing! One of you tail on the falls! … Lower slowly—slowly or you’ll swamp her! Stand by, lads! Now, ease off—ease off!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaning over the slanting rail Cardigan saw the dark shape of the boat plunge downward, saw it strike the sea and ride free of the hull, borne on a white surge. How small, how helpless it looked, down there in the mist, thought Cardigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are all hands there?” he called, as the last man shot down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All but the men for’ard, sir,” answered a voice from the misty smudge below. “They didn’t have a chance when she struck. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan, preparing to swing down the line, felt a peculiar reluctance to abandon the brig. Suppose, after all, the cabin-boy was somewhere—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought sped like steel through his brain. The Malay knife. He was leaving that behind. Queer that one should suddenly remember a fragment of sentiment amid such chaos—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lay her nose close in, lads!” he ordered over the rail. “I’m going to have a look below. If I’m not back in four minutes don’t wait. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made his way to the companion, climbing down the almost inverted stairs into the main cabin, where the water reached his waist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting more to his sense of direction than his outstretched hands, he groped his way aft, beneath the decks, to the paint-locker. In the misty ghost- light that spilled through the nearly demolished deck above he found the nail- riven iron door and drew back the bolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a shriek of hinges it swung out —spitting a large object in the waist- deep flood. Cardigan swore aloud as he perceived it to be a human body; bent over; lifted it; cursed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the cabin-boy—bound and gagged!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the half-light he could see the mutely imploring eyes—dark pools of pain. With haste he secured the Malay knife and severed the bonds, afterward removing the gag from the bruised, swollen mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… God, sir,” burst out The Boy, “they knocked me in the head, ’Poleon Moncrief and another … I couldn’t see his face, but he said—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell me later,” cut in Cardigan. “We haven’t time now; the ship’s sinking… . Can you walk? … I’ll help you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mate half-dragged The Boy along the passage and into the main cabin; here he set him on his feet and thrust him toward the vague gray light in the companionway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As The Boy began the ascent, clinging to the rail, he heard a crash behind him, a ripping and splintering of broken timbers, and, looking back, he saw something long and dark, the shape of a spar, plunge from aloft and smite Cardigan on the head. With a splash the first mate sank beneath the ugly water in the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boy shrieked. For an instant he stood motionless, paralyzed, then stumbling down the stairs he groped in the flood for the body. Almost instantly he was rewarded. With trembling fingers he sought the heart. It was beating. He laughed hysterically and began to drag the limp form after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midway up the companion-stairs he was brought to a standstill by a sound below, a half croak and half shriek: “On deck, you lubbers! … Sahibhai! …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He understood. Kerachi, the parrakeet, was down there in that black hole—but he could not go back until he had carried Cardigan to safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A form suddenly blotted out the square of foggy gray light that defined the companion. Following that English Charlie’s voice called, “Mr. Cardigan!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here!” answered The Boy. “For God’s sake take him! He was hit by a spar! … I’ve got to go back—after the parrakeet!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he turned to descend the cockney gripped his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come back, yeh blarste’d little fool! You’ll be drowned—” But The Boy broke away and plunged down into the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hush that seemed intensified rather than ruptured by the dull, ominous pounding of the waves against the sodden hull brooded in the bowels of the vessel—as if the very timbers of the stricken brig were smitten dumb with dreadful expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It corrupted The Boy with terror, this hush, but he forced himself to stagger through the water into the flooded passage amidships. Ahead, the bulkhead door hiccoughed yellow light. It gave warmth to his chilled soul, and in another instant he reached the entrance to the fo’castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slush-lamp lay against the beam, spluttering feebly with every heave of the vessel. The foul hole was half-inundated and a great wound in the port bulwarks bled a steady stream of sea water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kerachi!” called The Boy, searching in the flood for the little bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if answering him, the parrakeet, perched upon the top of the furthest bunk, croaked: ”Chota hasri, sahibs…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a thing occurred that drew The Boy’s heart into his throat: a human hand rose suddenly from behind an overturned table that floated near the second bulkhead door … clawed at the air … sank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Help … pleaded a faint voice. “A spar … pinned me here … in the passage door… . I’m killed unless. …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blood in The Boy’s veins seemed for the moment sucked up. The voice! Pain had weakened it to scarcely above a whisper, but he recognized it, this voice that he would remember until Death wiped free his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m coming!” he answered, suffused With fright and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he moved forward a sudden lurch of the brig sent the lamp crashing against the bulkhead. He stumbled; clutched at something tangible; clung. With a sense of aching despair he realized that he was denied the sight of—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness had hardly shut its jaws upon the foul hole when the parrakeet shrieked: “Two bells, mate, two bells … “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instant of frightful silence came on the heels of the bird’s speech, then: “God, how did you know?” shrilled the voice. “That was when I stabbed him. … As I pulled the knife out two bells struck… . ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boy felt a sudden quiver of the planks beneath his feet, heard a ripping sound forward … and a sudden convulsion of the water flung him backward. Terrified, he regained his balance and groped until he found and pulled himself through the bulkhead- door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How he made the main cabin he never knew. After a period of breathless struggle, bruised and hurt, almost strangled by the deepening flood, he reached the foot of the now inverted companion-stairs and began to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was almost at the top when a great wave, hurled through the companion above, descended upon him and bore him, gasping and choking, into the liquid blackness below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world swung around in giddy chaos. He experienced a terrible plunging sensation; torrents of delirious water passed over him; pitiless night swirled its black currents about his struggling body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buoying himself upward, battling against the legions of water, he strove to attain the surface. His thrashing arms struck something hard. At the contact his body went rigid with horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceiling of the cabin. Trapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fierce exultation possessed him— the glory of struggle. He tried to fight, but the liquid death crushed him. He screamed—was choked. He knew the torture of suffocation, a seemingly endless period of terror and pain such as he had never known, even when the lash of Black Michael curled about his bare skin; and a vivid, blinding flash of the concentrated events of many years leaped like hundred-hued lightnings athwart his drowning eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this glow, surrounded by tiny reeling stars, he saw The White Lotus … burning with the fire of palest moons—a figure that faded, became as destroyed moonlight, a vanishing glory that perished the very instant that it flashed to light his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“la ora na i te Atna …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark sluicegates closed upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;do-dead-men-laugh&quot;&gt;Do Dead Men Laugh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“’Ere she goes, mateys—look!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the first thing that Cardigan heard, a sentence that clove the fabric of unconsciousness and left him lying, pained to the soul, in what seemed a vast, misty cavern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He felt intermittent sprays upon his face and tried to struggle to a sitting position, but an intense burning in his skull made him fall back. He opened his lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Charlie … where are you ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instant afterward a huge face, seeming wraithlike in the fog, materialized in the dusky vacancy above him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She’s just gone down, sir!” the third mate said in a husky voice. “Gawd, it was orful … with the little fool aboard—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You mean—?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yerss. ’E dragged you up the companionway and Hi ’elped lower you into the long-boat. … We’d ’ardly got away, sir, when she went back orf the rocks … straight down.” He paused, then: “Shall Hi call the roll, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan shuddered involuntarily. “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He saw English Charlie rise; his head was lost in the mist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Watkins!” began the Britisher. “Here!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sykes … Ladd	… Cheng Su … Olsen … Huldricksson … Hickey—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The nigger was locked in the brig,” put in a voice from the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stearns!” went on the cockney. “Moncrief—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He went overboard. …” This from Cardigan in a half-whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, “Bjornsen. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bjornsen did not answer. Nor could anyone account for the big Norwegian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardigan went to his grave wondering who had struck Black Michael first, ’Poleon Moncrief or The Boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps the spirit of Bjornsen, knowing this and possessing a grim sense of humor, chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do dead men laugh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;breakin-out&quot;&gt;Breakin’ Out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Ryan tossed aside the magazine he’d been reading by the dingy light of a bulb overhead. But he didn’t get up from the cot, as Sheriff Capehart came along the shadowy corridor that led back to the cellblock. Nick was a slim, dark young man with sly features. He was openly contemptuous of everybody in his hometown of Piney Point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Capehart, a heavy, middle-aged man with phlegmatic grey eyes, came up close to the bars and stood looking at Nick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinning slyly, Nick asked, “You come to turn me loose, sheriff?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, I didn’t,” grunted the sheriff. “I came to ask if you want to confess killin’ my brother Sam before I go to bed.” “Surely you don’t think I’d kill anybody!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I sure do! You hid in Sam’s hardware and jewelry store until after he’d closed and was working on his books. You made him open his safe, cleaned out from it all the watches and rings and money and suchlike, then you killed him. You killed him, because he knew who you were.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick looked grieved. “Sheriff, you make me feel bad. Here I am, a hometown boy who went off to the big city and made good. Then, when I come back to visit my poor old father, you throw me in the clink and accuse me of murder. Why, you knew me when I was a kid—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s just it—a thievin’, window breaking alley rat! And I’ve heard a lot of worse things about you since you went off to Pittsfield. Mixed up with Sledge Mangrum’s bunch up there, ain’t you? And you didn’t come home on a visit— you come to rob somebody!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I killed Sam Capehart?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because you’d been hangin’ about his store for the last couple of days. You were seen to go into the store just a little while before he closed the day he was killed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I went out again by the back door. I could prove that by your brother Sam, if he wasn’t dead.” There was open mockery in Nick’s laugh. “Anyway, I’ve got an air-tight alibi. The night Sam Capehart was killed and robbed, I was at home all night. That’s a pretty hot alibi, ain’t it? My own father’s word?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheriff growled, “Tebe Ryan’s a lazy, booze-swillin’ thief and always was! He’d sooner lie than tell the truth.” /But it’d carry weight in court. Maybe I killed Sam Capehart. Sheriff, but you’ve got no proof and you know it. That lawyer I brought down from Pittsfield is pretty slick. He says that if you don’t produce some evidence, you can’t hold me any longer than tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheriff sighed. “Looks like he’s right. I know you killed poor Sam, but I can’t prove it. Reckon I’ll—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ll stay still, if you want to live!” a cold voice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Capehart turned and looked surprisedly at the two men who had stepped from the shadowy corridor behind him. One was chunky and dark, the other tall, with pale eyes and a hooked nose. They had wicked-looking automatics in their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheriff said belligerently, “What’s this? What’re you two doin’ here? Don’t you know I’m the sheriff?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure, we know it,” snapped the tall man. He shoved the sheriff back into the corridor. “Get up front, Fatty!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Ryan got up from the cot. He could see the two shoving Sheriff Capehart along the corridor. He heard the sheriff protest shrilly, “Hold on here! I’m the law—you can’t—” He saw the automatic in the tall man’s hand rise and fall, saw the sheriff wilt down to the floor and lie there still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two came back to the cellblock. The tall man said, “Get the keys, Blackie.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark man took a ring holding several keys from a nail on the wall. He opened Nick’s cell door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, Nick,” the pale-eyed man said coldly. “Get your hat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick was puzzled. He didn’t know these two. He backed to the cot and sat down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll sit this one out,” he said. “That dumb sheriff’s got nothin’ on me. I’ve got a hot alibi. I’d be a sap to break out of here, when I’ll be out legally in twenty- four hours anyway. I’m not goin’ anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you think, smart aleck!” The tall man slapped Nick, hard, caught him by the shoulder and flung him toward the cell door. “Step out, fast!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick didn’t argue any more. He didn’t know yet what cooked, but he knew that these two weren’t here as friends, as he had at first thought. The men with the guns were close behind him as he went along the corridor, stepped over the sheriff’s still form, went through the sheriff’s office at the front of the one-story brick building and onto the street. The street was deserted, for it was after midnight and only dimly lighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;settin-in&quot;&gt;Settin’ In&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dark sedan was drawn up at the curb half a block away. Blackie slid under the wheel, the tall man got in the back seat with Nick. The automatic was still in his hand. Blackie started the engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which way, Jake?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Straight for Pittsfield,” Jake said. “We’re safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sedan moved out of town and at a moderate speed northward along the highway. Nobody spoke for a couple of miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Nick said angrily, “Would you mind telling me what the hell this is all about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sledge wants to see you,” Jake said briefly. “He heard you were in that hick jail. He sent us to get you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sledge Mangrum? What’s he want to see me about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know what about. It was a crazy thing, Nick, killing Sledge’s kid brother Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Somebody’s crazy, all right! But if somebody killed Joe Mangrum, it wasn’t me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sledge thinks different. He knows you and Joe had some trouble over a chick, knows you threatened to kill the kid. So when Joe was found in a back room of Marty’s place with a blade in his gullet—with Marty swearing you and Joe had come in together—Sledge started looking for you. It gave me the creeps, hearing some of the things Sledge swore he’d do to yon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick was quiet a moment, feeling cold and leaden in his stomach. He wasn’t really on the inside of Sledge Mangrum’s gang, only on the fringe, because Sledge had turned thumbs down on him. He knew little about Big Sledge, but he’d heard things that made his insides curl up, about what Sledge did to those he didn’t like. He knew Sledge’s kid brother Joe, a wicked, strutting little rat. They’d fought over a girl one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’d heard that Sledge Mangrum loved only one thing on earth—that vicious, swaggering kid brother of his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look,” Nick said. “When did Joe get it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Last Monday night, about midnight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then I can prove I didn’t do it. I was here, in Piney Point, last Monday midnight!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe. In a jail cell?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, that wasn’t till Tuesday. I was—” Nick stopped. At midnight Monday he had been in Sam Capehart’s store. It was just about then that he’d killed a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tires whined on the pavement. The pines on each side of the highway were dark and still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackie said over his shoulder, “Remember what Sledge done to Mack Parker the time Mack double-crossed him? Mack’s mind never was right after that. They had to put him away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick blurted, “Damn it, didn’t I say I didn’t kill Joe?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell that to Sledge,” Jake murmured. “But it’ll take more than just your word, or your old man’s, to make him believe it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What if I could prove I was two hundred miles from Pittsfield at midnight Monday?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’d be fine for you, but I don’t think you can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure, I can,” Nick said eagerly. “You know why I was in the can?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know all about it. So what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know what time Sam Capehart was killed and robbed?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“About midnight, they claim, on Monday—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was me that pulled that job! I couldn’t have done that, and killed Joe Mangrum in Pittsfield at the same time, could I?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackie laughed. “No soap, Wick. We know that dumb sheriff just picked you up on suspicion. You didn’t croak old Capehart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I did, I tell you! If I showed you the loot—the watches and rings and stuff—that would prove it, wouldn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake said slowly, “Nick, you’re a sneaky, blood-thirsty little rat. But you show me that and I’ll tell Sledge you didn’t kill Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick took a deep breath of relief. “A couple of miles ahead a gravel road turns off to the left into the woods. Follow it, and I’ll show you where the stuff is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later the sedan was bumping along a crooked, forest-hemmed side road. At a word from Nick, Blackie stopped the car at a narrow concrete bridge. Nick got out, followed by Jake with the gun, and went down into the dry creek bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black satchel was cunningly hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the road, in the glare from the car lights, Jake opened the satchel. It was crammed with glittering jewelry and money. Some of the price tags carried the name of Sam Capehart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That satisfy you?” Nick asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It sure does,” Jake said. But he didn’t put away his gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headlights of a car approached swiftly along the old gravel road. The car stopped and a heavy figure got out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, boys?” Sheriff Capehart asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, sheriff,” Jake said. “He’s your meat, well-done!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That coldness was in Nick Ryan’s stomach again. He knew suddenly that he’d been a sucker. He said furiously, “You double-crossin’ snakes! Joe Mangrum’s not dead! You two don’t belong to Sledge Mangrum’s gang!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did they tell you that?” The sheriff snapped a pair of handcuffs on Nick’s wrists. “Why, they’re just a couple of boys from over at Rockport that I got to help me. They wouldn’t hurt a grasshopper. It was a real hot alibi you had to prove you never killed my brother Sam, Nick. But not hot as the chair you’ll soon be settin’ in!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;horse-opera&quot;&gt;Horse Opera&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Carl Connor, K-T’s best director, was putting the finishing touches on the next take, my eyes wandered over the Hollywood studio lot. Over to the left were the red-tiled office buildings blistering and peeling under the torrid August sun. Lazy-looking employees wandered indifferently across the shaggy lawns. In fact, King-Tanger Studios seemed to have gone to the dogs in the three years I was away. Why, when Uncle King was alive—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, Mister Kelley!” Connor snapped at me sarcastically. “Anytime you’re ready!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” I grinned. “Shoot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His sharp eyes, owlish under heavy glasses, pinned me down. “I hope you know what’s going on!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure,” I said blithely. “Good old B-7 Western! Just as Kirk Tanger steps out, I jump in and take his place for the scrap. Then I leap on my—rather his— faithful nag and ride away down the set with bullets nipping at my ears.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an outdoor set, the old saloon front, and dusty cowtown street that I remembered so vividly from the old days. Like everything I’d seen on the lot in the three days I had been back from overseas, it looked on its last legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk Tanger, who had been co-owner with my Uncle King of K-T—and who now owned it all—was the star. He didn’t seem to like my coming back at all, though he hid his dislike under that famous back-slapping personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But under Kitty Riley’s persuasion, he offered me a job doubling for him in the horse opera. He knew I could handle my dukes with the best of them, and that years on my uncle’s ranch had made the feel of a pony under me the most natural thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take him up on it, mostly so I’d be near Kitty. I didn’t like the way they acted in the clinches. Kirk Tanger was ten years older than I. But we did have about the same build. He’s six foot one, rangy and slim, with wide shoulders and narrow hips. He’s got curly brown hair and a self-important swagger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The director grunted. I watched Tanger ham it up with his favorite heavy, Lank Rennagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve run this cowtown long enough, Jake Carson!” Tanger cried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rennagan, big, dirty-faced, ugly, mugged and taunted him while the cameras rolled. “Why, you lily-livered pup. I’ll—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanger, ye hero, started circling him. I waited for my cue. It came when Tanger backed up and enveloped the camera eye for a split-second. I darted in swiftly and made with the fists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast and furious action followed. I popped about his ears while his haymakers whizzed around mine. I was careful to pull my punches. The sound effects would help the illusion along, plus additional speeding up, and spliced-in close- ups of Tanger’s pretty puss, so the movie-goers would think it was him all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played it up hot and heavy, like the freckle-faced kids in the front row like it, then I flattened the “bad guy,” leaped on Tanger’s pinto, and raised dust down the fake cowtown street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cameras ground on. This was a cheap quickie. Tanger wasn’t wasting any film. Guns roared behind me. I thought I felt something zing past my ear. The thought made me grin. As if anybody would be using real bullets? But when I ambled back for a retake, Kitty, who was the femme lead, stared at me with wide hazel eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jack!” she cried. “You’re bleeding!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ear did sting, so I put my hand up to it. It came back red. “Must of nicked it in the scrap,” I smiled casually. After three years as tail gunner a little scratch like that doesn’t seem anything to get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanger walked up just then. He looked pale under his bottled suntan. I noticed a blood vessel in his temple hopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come on over to the dispensary, pal,” he said. “I’ll touch it up for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-live-bullet&quot;&gt;A Live Bullet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed him into the little studio dispensary, wondering what was up. Why was Tanger calling me pal, all of a sudden, when everybody on the lot knew Kitty had tossed him over for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked a little like brothers, dressed alike in the same flashy Western breeches and boots. Mine were a little roughed up after a hard day’s shooting, and my face didn’t need fake tan. It was browned permanently by South Pacific trade winds. The lines around my eyes and mouth didn’t get there from cutting up around Hollywood spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Listen, Kelley,” Tanger said, booting the door shut behind us, “you didn’t nick yourself fighting. A live bullet did that!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I examined it critically in the mirror. Could be. “What makes you think so?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw the puff of smoke from the harness shop window. I ran around fast as I could, behind. I got just a glimpse of the man who shot you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’d he look like?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Couldn’t see his face because he wore a black mask.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mask?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Don’t you get it, Kelley? Both you and I—and Rennagan too, when he’s pulling a trick—wear a ‘masked rider’ get-up in the picture. Another masked rider floating around the lot wouldn’t excite any comment!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I winced as he painted up my scratch and taped it. “Smart guy,” I whistled. “Now, who do you suppose wants me out of the way?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanger shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not you. Me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You?” I asked innocently. Offhand I could think of half a dozen reasons, all of them blonde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanger’s pretty face writhed, “I can’t tell you what it’s all about, Kelley, but believe me. I know. The man who’s out to get me doesn’t know I use a double. He doesn’t know you. Now, here’s what I want you to do …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw it coming. I knew all along Tanger had something up his sleeve when he brought me in here. I shrugged noncommittally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to do it, pal!” he insisted desperately. “It’s important to the whole studio. Without me this picture will never be finished. If it isn’t, no more K-T. He’s out to get me. He’s a cold-blooded killer. Will stop at nothing! You’ve just got to help me, pal!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed, facing him. “Just what do you want me to do about it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He slapped my shoulder, his face glowing with relief. “I knew you’d do it, pal!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I winced. This pal stuff didn’t set well with me. It was a lot different from the way Tanger acted when I first got back. Oh, well. That was because of Kitty. Tanger had been trying to convince her she ought to marry him ever since I left. From the way she, herself, had been acting, I wasn’t sure he hadn’t succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Easy on the orchids,” I murmured. “I haven’t said I’d do anything yet.” The sore look that flashed in his eyes vanished quick-like. He put on a bland ingratiating tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nothing to it, Kelley. All I want is for you to pretend to be me for the next few days, until the picture’s wrapped up. Live at my place in Beverly Hills. Go to the premiere tonight. Use my car and chauffeur. Why, it’s a breeze!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t much care for the breeze that bullet made fanning my ear,” I reminded him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s five grand in it,” he said. Funny how the mention of a nice round sum like five thousand dollars can change a guy’s mind. Kitty and I could get married. I could buy in with Old Karpis at his movie horse-trainer ranch out in the Valley, as I’d always wanted. As Tanger said, three years of it had made me rather immune to the smell of danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-top-kick-of-k-t&quot;&gt;The Top Kick of K-T&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night was typical Hollywood. The heat of the day had cooled down considerably. The sky had shaded down to a deep, rich cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat back luxuriously in Tanger’s smooth limousine, wearing his best tux and smoking one of his best cigars, while Jim, his chauffer, sent the hade spinning down the Sunset Strip out of Beverly Hills, then veering onto Hollywood Boulevard toward the nest of fanning arc-fights that stabbed their wag prettily toward the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood was doing itself proud at this big-time premiere. As top-kick of K-T, it was Tanger’s duty to put to in an appearance. Tonight, with my face deftly made up, I was Tanger. He himself would come, slip in with the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim braked the car smoothly in front of the mobbed entrance canopy, which was flanked on either side by bleacher seats that had been rigged up for the occasion. With hundreds of movie fans’ eyes drilling me as they babbled their criticisms, I stepped down the brightly lit carpeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I saw Kitty. She was breathtaking in a knockout of a blue evening dress with silver sequins. I forgot I was putting on an act and hurried up to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why, Kirk!” I took her arm, then noticed her staring at the neat square of tape on my ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why, you’re not—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shushed her quickly, and we went in. During the show I spent my time trying to dope out this deal. I hadn’t had a good chance to talk to Kitty since I got back, with Tanger monopolizing her, and had hoped to later. Somehow, in the mob, I lost track of her. Then a couple reporters buttonholed me. I had to lam out before one of them found out I wasn’t really Tanger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the car. It was parked around the corner on a shady little side- street, as I had instructed. That’s one thing about Hollywood. Two blocks off the main drag and you might be m some quiet little hamlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Jim,” I said, hopping in. “Let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chauffeur’s cap ahead of me nodded, and we were off, suddenly. I happened to glance m the mirror over the chauffeur’s head. “Hey, you’re not Jim I” I yelled, “Who—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He flashed a pistol, managing to keep his eyes on the road and on me in the little mirror as we swerved around a corner on two wheels and started east op into the Hollywoodland hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sit still, Tanger!” he snapped roughly. “This is where you get took!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;end-of-the-line&quot;&gt;End of the Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t bother to disabuse him of the idea that I was Tanger. I was worried about his driving. It was as if he had suddenly gone nuts. He took those hairpin turns on two wheels. All I could see were his eyes and a rough pen of makeup. He was a bad actor, all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lit a cigarette and sat back. The long car hurtled upward through the brilliant night, then suddenly braked at the brink of a five-hundred-foot drop. It was a lonely scrubby stretch, with the city spread out below like a jeweled pattern. He leaped out, flung open my door, shoving his gun to my face. “All right, chiseler,” he snapped. “This is the end of the line.” He might he a ham-actor, as I decided, but he wasn’t acting now. This was the real McCoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grinned back at him impishly. “Take it slow,” I soothed. Then I jumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of my sudden lunge sent him reeling back a step, with a grunt of surprise. His gun flung lead between my crooked elbow and my midriff. I could feel death tickle my ribs with the end of his scythe. I put everything I got into a swift uppercut. His head snapped back. My other fist cracked down on his gun-hand, sent the roscoe flying off into all those spangled lights, into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a snarl he was out of his spin and on me. His fingers reached for my throat. Then we were waltzing dreamily on the graveled edge of that cliff. I had his wrists and was trying to pin them back. He shook loose and started slugging and gouging. He was no mean shakes. He knew a thing or two, must have learned it from the Japs, it was that dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He faked, as if I’d hit him too low. I fell for it. In the second I relaxed his fist came up. Everything swam around me. Or maybe it was me who was swimming, going around and round on the black wall of the hell-deep whirlpool. Above me hung an ugly paint-smeared puss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed out at him feebly, yanked. He moved back, but I caught his shirt. Buttons scattered. Then I went down into that whirlpool, with a faint faraway sound like a siren screaming—or maybe a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was one shred left of my shattered consciousness. One chunk of knowledge that stayed with me through the aeons of bad dreams that followed. It was the sight of the slugger’s swirling black chest—and of a triangular red mole on his throat, on the lower part of his left breastbone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-5&quot;&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-raw-deal&quot;&gt;A Raw Deal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feel of soft hands on my forehead helped me out of it. It was nice. Pain shot through me in seven directions, but those cool hands helped a lot. When I opened my peepers, relief rolled over me in a tidal wave. I wasn’t in some nasty old Jap prison camp; I was in Kitty Riley’s apartment. She was looking down at me with sorry, anxious eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What gives?” I wondered, with a low groan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Easy, soldier,” she soothed me, in that low husky voice of hers. “You’ve had quite a time for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered everything. I sat up quickly. “What happened?” I demanded, feasting my eyes on her soft taffy ringlets and wide kissable lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were at the premiere, remember?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure. I lost you in the mob. Go on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I bumped into Kirk. He yanked me out of a side door with him.” Her voice was like dripping honey. “I had my coupe. Kirk offered to drive me home, and on the way I noticed your car. The driver seemed to be hopped up, so I insisted that we follow you. Of course my jalopy can’t keep up to Kirk’s limousine, which you were in, so we lagged behind, making those hills the best we could. We reached you just as you went into your tailspin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about the pug?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got away. Jumped in the car and beat it. As I said,” she smiled, “my little coupe is no match for that big bus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What happened to Jim?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kirk called me a few minutes ago to see if you had come out of it yet. It seems Jim got a message, ostensibly from his boss, telling him to leave the car and hurry home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded, scowling. “So Jim went, and my would-be killer took his place. Did you notify the cops?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty shook her shiny curls. “Kirk said no. He looked you over. Said you would be okay, and wanted it hushed up. It all has to do with whoever he’s afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got any ideas about that?” I asked casually, lighting a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No-o.” She looked thoughtful. “Wait. Yes, I have. You know Mocardai?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The gambling house king? I’ve heard of him. He’s a nice character to cross.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kirk owes him money. A lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried my legs and found I could stand up, if a little shakily. “Jack,” Kitty said, in a low different voice, “why don’t you go away?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I—I don’t know what this is all about, exactly, but why stick your neck out?” I eyed her carefully. She looked sincere enough, but then, Kitty’s quite an actress. On a hunch I asked, “What’s about the studio?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In a pretty bad way, Jack,” she wagged her blonde head. “Seems as if nobody will take a chance on Kirk Tanger, since your Uncle King died. It’s all rather odd.” She put her soft hand on my arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jack, I’ve always thought you got a raw deal. King meant to leave his half of K-T to you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled crookedly. “That was before I enlisted. King’s doctor could have kept me out, he thought. I couldn’t see it that way at all. You know King. As long as you did things his way everything was fine. The minute you crossed him he dropped you like a hot grenade. Tanger stayed. I didn’t. That’s the whole story in a nutshell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty looked so genuinely sorry about it that I planted a kiss square on her wide lips. It tasted wonderful, but I still wasn’t sure. “Good-bye,” I told her and scrammed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-6&quot;&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;last-will-and-testament&quot;&gt;Last Will and Testament&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hours I slept, then went out to the studio. It was a good half hour before shooting time. Contrary to propaganda, a star’s day starts real early and lasts real late sometimes. With a quickie Western like this one, it was even tougher. Tanger was shooting it on a shoestring, and a frayed one at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out from the gateman that Tanger’s office was vacant, so I slipped in the back way. I used one of my uncle’s keys which I had found among his personal effects. I left the blinds down while I went over the joint. Since Tanger wasn’t going to let me in on his little secret I was going to probe it out for myself. If I was going to continue dodging bullets, I was going to know why. Furthermore, as Kitty hinted, there was something mighty funny going on at K-T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw that one of the desks had been taken out. A single big mahogany affair filled the center of Tanger’s private office. I tried the drawers first. Nothing unusual. Then I turned my attention to the metal wall cabinets. At first I found nothing there, either, until I found a green strongbox tucked way down in at the bottom. It was heavy so I set it down on the floor. The lock was a good one, but I remembered King’s key ring and tried them, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my knees by it, I flung the cover back and combed through its contents. I whistled when I found it. The envelope was marked, Last Will and Testament. Herbert J. King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uncle. It was dated July 8th, just three days before he died. I broke the seal and started reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I, Herbert J. King, being of sound mind and—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard the back door snap shut softly behind me. I whirled in time to catch just a glimpse of a black shadow wearing a mask. Before I could get to my feet he lunged, pounced on me like a panther. My head hit a corner of the cabinet. For a few seconds all I saw were stars. When I came out of it he had vanished out of the back door, the envelope and will along with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sprang after him, muttering a few choice words I had picked up in New Guinea. I flung open the door in time to see Kirk Tanger striding bare-headed toward the office, dressed in cowboy togs, his spurs jingling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked surprised to see me coming out of the back door of his private office, but only smiled amiably. “Waiting to see me, Kelley?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” I watched him narrowly. “I want some information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled that famous smile. “I get it, Kelley. Since tangling with a gunman last night, you figure it’s time I let you in on what it’s all about. Eh, pal?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, pal, I was on my way to find you. It’s like this. I ran up a sizable gambling debt with Mocardai, and he doesn’t like waiting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And he decided to take it out of your hide?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s it,” Tanger nodded. “Last night I got him to call off his hounds. I convinced him that I can settle up as soon as this picture is finished, which will be in a few days. He’s willing to wait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All nice and smooth, but it didn’t set well in my craw. It matched what Kitty had told me last night, but that just put her in the shade alongside Tanger. Well, maybe you couldn’t blame a girl for changing her mind about a guy, once she found out he was not going to inherit half a movie studio. Just suppose, for instance, that Kitty hadn’t just “happened” to follow me last night. Suppose Tanger wasn’t with her at all. Suppose that he—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That did it. The rising tide of anger inside me swept up into my brain. I made a quick grab at Tanger’s silk collar,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What goes on?” he grinned, good-naturedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nothing,” I mumbled. “Nothing at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked away fast, stiff-legged. I was wrong. Dead wrong. There was no triangular red mole on Tanger’s chest. No mole of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-7&quot;&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-triangular-red-mole&quot;&gt;A Triangular Red Mole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s takes were to be some of the last big scenes. All the location shots were completed, processed and ready for cutting in the lab, having been filmed the week before up in the Sherwood Lake country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the usual barroom free-for- all, with the usual collapsing chairs and bottles busted over heads. It played havoc with the flimsy set, making it unlikely that it would stand up under another such brawl or even a retake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Connor, the director, barked out orders for the final to-the-death battle between Lank Rennagan, the heavy lead, and the hero. In the eyes of the public, Kirk Tanger. Actually me. Tanger wouldn’t dream of risking that pretty face of his before the cameras, any more than he would risk it in real life. Or would he, I wondered, if the stakes were high enough. A couple of telephone calls had told me a lot that I hadn’t known before, and was never intended to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connor’s heavy voice bawled instructions. Mopping his bald dome that glinted under the heavy lights, he finished, “Adlib it. But make it good! We don’t want to have any retakes! Can’t afford it! Make it real!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rennagan grinned at me wolfishly. There was an odd gleam in his eyes, but it didn’t really register until a little later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cameras rolled. Rennagan came at me, mugging ferociously. I slipped under his lunge and landed a make-believe punch on his jaw. His head went back and he sprawled on the floor. Then he was up again and at me. We clinched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of his slugs landed hard, but it can’t be entirely faked. I thought nothing of it until his hairy arm grabbed me suddenly and yanked me down behind the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened fast. His left hand seized my throat and forced me flat against the floor. Then he grabbed a half-smashed bottle, a real one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a glimpse of his hairy chest. There was a red mole on it. A triangular red mole. So now I knew! Rennagan was the one I had tangled with last night. He was going to finish the job now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studio accidents do happen. He’d purposely got me behind the bar, out of camera range, so he could make it look like that. “This time you’ll stay out!” he whispered. I saw the ragged edge of glass swing down at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweating blood, I yanked to one side in time, swung a roundhouse into his solar plexus. He gave a howl of anguish and let the bottle drop. My boot went out into his belt, and sent him flying into the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leaped after him. Fury was upon me. I forgot all about cameras and movies. All I knew was that Rennagan had tried to kill me, at least twice. I plastered my fists all over his greasy pan. I hit him over and over again, until I was out of wind. Then, as he sagged, I cracked out once more, with all my weight behind it. He dropped without a sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bravo!” Connor applauded behind me as the cameras stopped. ‘‘Best scrap I’ve directed in fifteen years!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;yellow-bellied-4f&quot;&gt;Yellow-Bellied 4F&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swayed there a moment, getting back my wind. Ignoring Connor’s orchids, I walked up to Kirk Tanger, who was standing off to one side with Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He meant to kill you!” Kitty cried tremulously. “I saw it in his eyes!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” I said, stroking my cut knuckles. My eyes were on Tanger. He was pale. The smile on his pan looked lopsided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nonsense!” he said, trying to laugh it off. “Why Rennagan’s the best heavy on the lot!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That why you picked him to get rid of me last night?” I demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“W-What—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you think it’s about time you quit play-acting? You’re not that good!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He drew himself up. “I don’t know what you mean, Kelley.” He started to stalk away, insulted. I stuck out my arm and twirled him around so I could look him square in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You milked your way into Uncle King’s favors ever since he picked you up on the street and brought you to K-T. When you became a star, you bought in. When I enlisted, and you yellow-bellied your way into a 4-F classification, you put on the pressure. You all but kissed his boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You knew he had a bad heart. So when he told you about the new will he made, in my favor, you decided both he and I had to die. In his case it was easy. A drop of something in his heart medicine would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You hid the new will. You didn’t dare destroy it, because there was a witness, King’s valet. So you paid him off and got him to leave town. When I got back, you faked up this gag about somebody who was after you, and offered me five grand to take your place in order to make my death look completely accidental. You hired Rennagan to do your dirty work. But he bungled the job last night, so you told him to finish it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You knew I found that will in your office, because you were the masked character who stepped in on me. You knocked me down and ran out, tucked the will under your shirt and pulled off your mask, then came back, pretending you had just got there!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanger’s lips twitched. “You can’t prove any of this!” he retorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No? I checked the time you really came in the lot gate with the gateman. It matched. I found out from King’s valet’s mother where he had gone. I called him long distance. When I told him what I suspected, he came clean, told me all he knew about the new will, dispossessing you and making me controlling owner of K-T. Now, hand it over!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I—I haven’t got it!” Tanger cried. “I burned it! I mean—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, no, you didn’t!” Kitty told him, her eyes blazing with disgust. “I met Jack just after he left you. He told me to keep my eyes on you every second!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinning, I grabbed his pretty silk shirt and ripped it open. There was the will, tucked partway under his wide belt. I tossed it to Kitty, then grabbed Tanger by the belt and studied his pretty pan speculatively, as if wondering where I was going to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cowered back. “No! No!” he whimpered, having seen what his pal Rennagan got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t hit him!” Kitty cried. “Please don’t!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why not?” I demanded, scowling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Remember, dear,” she said sweetly, “This picture isn’t quite finished yet, and he is the star. We’ll need his slimy puss for some closeups, as is. As wife-to-be of the controlling owner of K-T I say we’ve got to be prudent! Mangle him later, dear!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pushed Tanger away and drew Kitty close to me, grinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anyhow,” I said. “Here’s one fade-out clinch where the double takes over!” I signaled to Connor. “Let ’em roll, professor!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rock-bound gulch, half-buried under the sands of summer, covered beneath ten feet of snow in winter, six skeletons lie, grinning mockingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hollow skulls of two are smooth, round holes. In one a tiny, leaden pellet leaps and bumps with each heave and groan of the sun-kissed ice in spring. The whitened ribs of two are seamed and scarred as by a knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the sixth there is no mark. Nor comes there any answering rattle when some loathsome reptile, scurrying from its lair amongst the rocks and crevices, jars against the whitened shell that once encased as foul a brain as e’er polluted God’s green footstool. It lies far apart from the others, denied, even in death, the solace of their companionship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of the tenant of that sixth grim remnant, gazing, hollow-eyed, toward the heavens it can never enter, that this story is written. The flesh that once covered his weather-bleached bones has long since been carried away by carrion birds; his malignant soul is now frying in hell—unless, by chance, the devil, fearing the corruption of his powers of darkness, has denied the spirit admittance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He mocked God and spit upon His Commandments. And the long arm of God reached out and found him—even in the chill, cold arctic hell where he had hidden himself away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-ever-mysterious-north&quot;&gt;The Ever-Mysterious North&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee was the first to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found him, a month after they had discovered that they were rich—cold and stiff, his face twisted into an indescribable grimace, as if he had died in awful agony. Yet there had been no outcry. Nor was there any mark upon his body to show how he had been struck down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six of them—Lee, the profane; Halligan, the religious; Mason, the student; Wentworth, ill-tempered and moody; Kelly, the hot-blooded Celt; and good-natured, plodding, old Drew—were from the same Mid-Western town. They had grown up together, attended the same school, soldiered in the same squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same girl had driven them to the land of long winters to seek their fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, smarting under the same misfortune, they had been drawn together, forgetting, for the time, their differences, sharing one another’s dangers, living out of a common purse, laughing at hardships—yet each praying that he might be the one upon whom Fortune’s smile would fall—buoyed up by the memory of a beautiful girl far, far from their adopted home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a fashion, they were happy. They were filled with primitive vigor and pulsing with life. They lived constant romances and did not know it. For such is the way of the far countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the lure of the North had gripped their heartstrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had been prospecting, without results, all summer, when they chanced upon the unmapped, blind canyon which was destined to he their burial place. Following the noisy little creek up the gulch to the spot where it bubbled from * the side of the rocky wall which blocked the farther end of the canyon, between two gray, grim mountains, they decided to “hole in” for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were signs of gold everywhere. A cabin, old and weatherbeaten—one of the unsolved mysteries of the ever-mysterious North—stood ready for their occupancy with a small amount of repairing. Near by were a dozen mounds —grim reminders of a tragic past. In the cabin were bags filled with nuggets, their coverings rotted away. The whole place breathed of mystery—of mystery and treasure untold. Wood was plentiful and game was abundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan and Lee were sent back for supplies. The others divided their time between prospecting the gulch and putting in shape their shack —a four-roomed affair—for they intended spending the winter in comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after the return of the two,-the partners awoke to the realization that they were rich. Before they could even estimate the extent of their find winter arrived, with its long, cold nights, burying the old cabin almost to the eaves under a mass of snow which filled the gulch, tying them up effectually for the remainder of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no stronger test of friendship than the placing of strong, vigorous men for several long, weary months in enforced confinement. With little to do save eat and sleep, forced to gaze at each other day after day, they are apt to fall into a physical lethargy which eventually creates a nervous tension like nothing else in the world. Petty quarrels become serious “matters. Molehills are magnified into mountains. They grow to hate the sight of each other— to become suspicious of what, under other circumstances, would not be noticed. And, when each looks upon his companions as his rivals for the hand of a beautiful woman, hell is bound to break loose sooner or later. It is as inevitable as fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-visitation-of-god&quot;&gt;The Visitation Of God&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they found the grisly horror that was Lee, lying stark and stiff in his bunk, gazing, glassy-eyed, toward the ceiling, there was no thought of foul play. It was Halligan who, in straightening out the cold, clinched fingers, discovered the tiny thread of gray wool in the doubled-up fist and called the attention of the others to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wentworth was the owner of the only gray shirt in the camp. The others wore khaki or blue. It had been a cold night and he had slept in it. Instantly all eyes were turned upon him, although no word was spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned upon his silent accusers, his lips drawn back in a wolfish snarl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Damn it! If you think I done it, say so!” he growled. “If I killed him, how did I do it—and when? You, Halligan, slept in the same room with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan shook his head sadly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I went to bed, the two of you, and Kelly, were soldering that hole in the old coffee-pot. I went to sleep before either of you turned in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly looked at Halligan angrily, then cast a sympathetic glance at Wentworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to say, boys, that I ‘hit the hay’ before the other two. I wish now that I hadn’t, because I’m confident that if Lee was killed—and I don’t think that he was—it wasn’t Wentworth that done it. He’s not that stripe. In fact.” he hastened on, “none of the bunch is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wentworth snorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keep your blasted sympathy to yourself! I don’t want it!” he growled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan shook his head mournfully. &amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s the visitation of God upon Lee for his blasphemy,” he muttered. “I warned him against it many a time— poor boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sat around all day discussing their-companion’s sudden taking away— all but Wentworth. He sat alone in a corner, silently nursing his grievances. They had searched the body; there was not a mark upon it. The other four were loud in their statements that Lee must have died a natural death. But there was a feeling of coldness—an indescribable something that cast a pall over them all—a feeling toward their once-trusted comrade—a feeling that the long, lonely days of idleness and soundless nights of the past now magnified into an unspoken suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the afternoon they carried Lee’s body up the gulch a few yards and buried it in a shallow grave dug in the ice .and snow, where it would have to lie until spring opened up again. The ground was frozen too hard to dig a grave being covered by a dozen feet of hard-packed snow and ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Wentworth remained away from the simple funeral, sitting glumly by himself inside the cabin while Halligan mumbled, brokenly, as much as he could remember of the burial service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late when they retired that night. All but Wentworth. He refused to eat any supper, throwing himself onto his bunk immediately after the others had finished eating, where he lay, scowling, his eyes staring into vacancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-pall-of-acrid-smoke&quot;&gt;A Pall Of Acrid Smoke&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They slept fitfully. It was nearly morning when they were awakened by the sharp explosion of a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They leaped to their feet and one of them struck a match and lighted a, flickering tallow candle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wentworth lay dead in his blankets. Over him hung a pall of acrid smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lay upon his back, a bullet hole in his temple, his lips drawn back in the same wolfish snarl he had worn during the day. On the floor beside him, where it had dropped from his nerveless hand, lay his revolver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next morning they buried him in the snow beside the man who they were now sure had been his victim. And once more it was Halligan who was called upon to say a prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again he repeated his warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can’t you see, boys,” he mourned, “that the Lord visited his wrath upon Wentworth for his sins—just as he did upon Lee. A man’s evil deeds will find him out. It’s a warning for you all to repent before it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no work done that day. Even the dishes were allowed to go greasy and unwashed while they discussed again and again the various phases of the second tragedy that had befallen their little community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wentworth had never been popular with the others, his moroseness and general tone of surly indifference to everything keeping him from being the general favorite that the profane but good-natured Lee had been. Yet it was hard to believe that he had stooped to murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, it was Halligan, the born leader, who aroused them from their apathy. Putting the others to cleaning up the dishes, he cooked a hasty supper and compelled the three to eat with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no use getting the doldrums,” he admonished them. “They’re dead, and sitting around mooning won’t bring ‘em back. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Of course, it’s up to us to see that their heirs get their share of the mine after we’ve taken our wages out for working it. When we’ve fed and cleaned up the shack we’ll have a game of cards and turn in early. I, for one, am sleepy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So were they all, for, within an hour after they had eaten, the four of them were yawning vigorously. They crawled into their bunks, Halligan, who refused to sleep in the room where Lee and Wentworth had met their deaths, climbing into a spare bunk with the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason was the first to awaken next morning. He shouted for the others as he leaped out of his blankets and crawled into his clothes. Replenishing the logs in the fireplace in the living-room, he again yelled at the other three and turned his attention to breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second later a loud cry from Kelly brought Halligan to his feet, while Mason ran in from the outer room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Drew lay dead in his bunk. Between his ribs, buried to the hilt, was a hunting-knife. And it was Mason’s knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-girl-and-the-money&quot;&gt;The Girl And The Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly carefully drew the knife from the wound and looked at the initials carved on the handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, ‘twas you, after all, was it, you skunk?” he snarled at Mason. “You with your damned sneaking ways and your smooth, oily manner, eh? Though why you were fool enough to leave your knife stickin’ in him is what I can’t understand. Scared away, were you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason stepped back a pace, a look of amazement on his proud face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I swear by the ever-living God, boys, that I am innocent!” he declared. “Why would I kill Drew?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why—yes, why?” snorted Kelly, his eyes glittering. “For the same reason that you killed Lee and threw the blame for it onto poor Wentworth, damn your soul! I suppose that Halligan and I were to be the next, eh ?” he went on. i tli us out of the way you’d be a rich man. And then you could go back and marry Cora Hunter. Oh, I’m no fool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan, sitting on the edge of his bunk putting on his moccasins, said nothing. Kelly, his Celtic temper leaping to the surface, was intensely angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason, too, was a man of hot passions, although he held them under better restraint than did the Irishman. He took a half-step toward his accuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kelly—and Halligan,” he began in a level voice, “I didn’t kill Drew, nor had I a hand in the death of Lee. It’s just as much of a mystery to me how my knife got there as it is to you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“’Tis no mystery to me,” snapped Kelly. “You put it there, you cur.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re a damned liar!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly leaped upon him, the knife he still held in his hand upraised. Mason’s fist met him half-way, striking him squarely in the face, but failing to stop his rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lurid oath the burly Irishman jabbed the weapon into the other’s side half a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his bare fists Mason fought the other as best he could for a second or two. His fingers clutched weakly about his antagonist’s windpipe. He struggled blindly for a second, fumbling feebly for a hold. Then his knees doubled under him and, with a dull moan, he sank to the floor at Kelly’s feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a sign of undue haste, Halligan buckled his belt and holster about his waist. Coolly he unbuttoned the holster and drew the gun. He cocked the weapon and, with his finger on the trigger, waited for the others to settle their argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you get him?” he asked, as Kelly stepped back and wiped the blood from his streaming nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, an’ I’m damned glad of it— the swine!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before he could turn around, Halligan placed the muzzle of his gun against the back of the Irishman’s head and pulled the trigger. A dazed expression crept over Kelly’s face. The knife dropped from his hand. Then he fell in a heap across the body of his late antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan replaced the weapon in its holster and felt of the Irishman’s heart. Assuring himself that it had ceased to beat, he raised his eyes to Mason, who was staring at him dazedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You saved my life, Halligan,” the wounded man muttered thickly; “but you took so long doing it that he got me anyway. Much obliged—just—same.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan grinned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If I did, I’m sorry,” he remarked, cheerfully. “ ‘Cause then I’ll have to finish you myself. It wouldn’t do for you to live, you see, because you know too much. And, besides, I want everything for myself—the girl and the money both.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dying man looked at him curiously. “You don’t mean that it was you, Halligan? Great God! And I never suspected!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan sat down on the edge of his bunk and laughed good-humoredly as he unbuckled his gun and threw it across the foot of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t mind telling you about it,” he said quietly, “because you’ll soon be where you can never tell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rolled a cigarette and, lighting it, inhaled a whiff before he continued: “You see, Mason, I figured out long ago that as soon as we struck it rich— and I felt sure that we would sooner or later—it would be a survival of the fittest. I knew that there was no chance for any of us with Cora until we had money. She’s a selfish little devil, but she’s worth fighting for. And, with all of us rich, we would be just where we started. But now it’ll be me alone— just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we struck pay here, you remember it was me that suggested putting in here for the winter. I knew that it would be easy for me to plant the seed of suspicion in all of you, for, deep down in your hearts, you all felt as I did and each one of you suspected the other. And you were as jealous as a bunch of chorus girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wentworth killed Lee all right. I watched him do it from the other room, where I was supposed to be asleep. I suggested the idea of it to him without him knowing it several days before. He and I were doing a job of soldering and I told him a story I got from my grandmother—about a man who had murdered his wife by pouring a drop of hot lead in her ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After Kelly turned in that night, Lee and Wentworth sat up soldering, you remember. Finally Lee dropped off to sleep with his head on the table. It was too good an opportunity for Wentworth to miss—for he hated Lee’s guts—so he drops a bit of the hot solder into Lee’s ear. He died without a struggle, as I knew he would—for the infernal stuff paralyzes every faculty. Afterward Wentworth took off his boots and sneaked in to see if we were asleep. Finding that we were, he carried Lee in and laid him on his bunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You remember how Wentworth tore his shirt on a nail there by the door? I recollected that there was a scrap of wool banging onto it. When Wentworth went back into the other room to put away his tools, I jumped out, took the little piece of wool from the nail and got it into Lee’s clenched fingers and jumped back into bed before Wentworth returned. Pretty smooth, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wentworth couldn’t stand the gaff. He imagined that I knew that he had killed Lee, so he killed himself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason groaned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I killed Wentworth!” he blurted out. “You told me that he had—that he—he—about what he done to—to Cora. I saw that this was a good opportunity to get rid of him and let you fellows think he had done it himself.” You put me up to it, you devil!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So it was you, after all, eh?” he chuckled. “I knew that you had swallowed my little story, but I’ll confess that I didn’t think you would get busy so quick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But the letter you showed me from her—from Cora?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan chuckled again. “Mason, I don’t mind telling you that when I went after supplies with Lee I fixed up five letters, all identical except the names. I put one of your names in each letter. I showed each one of you a different letter, playing each one of you against the other. That’s why Kelly knifed you. He didn’t care a cuss for Drew—he was itching for an opportunity to get you. See? I stuck Drew myself, using your knife to throw suspicion on you, knowing that it would start the Irishman. Where I miscalculated was in thinking that you’d be armed. I didn’t want to stain my own hands with murder any more than I had to. I put some dope in all of your grub last night when I got supper so that I could pull off the stunt without arousing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That idea of mine of playing each one of you against the other was pretty slick, wasn’t it? No one knows of the existence of this blind gulch here. I’ll have a pretty good nest egg, and, after I marry Cora, I can always take a run back here for more if I need it. Of course, I’ll bury all of you fellows nice and shipshape and I’ll tell them back home about our separating and each going in a different direction. Oh, I’ve got a good yarn cooked up, all right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wounded man glared at him malignantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Damn you!” he cried. “God’s long arm will get you yet—even out here in the ice and snow of this God-forsaken country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan smiled. “God? Bah! If I’d believed in such foolishness I’d never won out over the rest of you. But I made you think I did—and that’s how I got the best of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;beginning-of-the-end&quot;&gt;Beginning Of The End&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He arose and stretched himself. Then, seizing the dead man, he dragged his victim out of doors and buried him alongside of the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason watched him at his work with glaring eyes. Then, as he left the room, the wounded man dragged himself across the few feet that separated him from the bunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carefully, every movement filled with pain, he reached up and took the gun. He tried to lift himself to his feet and felt himself going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“O God,” he murmured, “help me— help me—get him—don’t let him get— away with it. Help me for Cora’s sake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He succeeded in getting the weapon cocked—in hiding it inside his trousers pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His jaw dropped and, with a convulsive twitch, he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halligan finished burying Kelly and returned to the cabin for warmth. Replenishing the fire, he entered the other room and found Mason dead. Throwing him across his shoulder, he staggered out into the gulch again and laid him on the snow crust while he hastily scooped another shallow grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He bent over the body to roll it into the hole. As he did so there was a flash and a report. The bullet swept across his lids, searing them with its heat. His eyes were filled with the powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinded, sobbing with his misery, he tried to grope his way back to the cabin. He lost his sense of direction. He stumbled and fell, arose and stumbled again. His snowshoes dropped from his feet. Too miserable to care, he tried to go on without them. He broke through the crust to his waist. On and on he floundered his way, whimpering with pain—chilled to the marrow—thinking to reach the cabin, but ever getting farther from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, exhausted, blinded, freezing, he fell into the stupor, which marks the beginning of the end in the Land of Eternal Snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sudden cold, grasping hold of the dead body of Mason, had hastened rigor mortis. The dead fingers, stiffening suddenly, had tightened about the trigger of the hidden revolver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the long arm of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;circumstantial-evidence&quot;&gt;Circumstantial Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any one around Headquarters was making a book on a Murder Handicap, I’d lay 100-to-l that Joe Gillen was guilty. A vicious and premeditated homicide, at that. But Howard—that is, Det. Chief Gwynn Howard—never said a word until the morning of the second day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Gillen was sobering up in the county jail across the street. Now, I’m no wizard at detectival deduction. I also know that circumstantial evidence can likewise be screwy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the records will show that most murder cases are cracked via circumstantial evidence; and if it wasn’t for such evidence a flock of homicidal hams would be acting in more murders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter from which angle you viewed Joe Gillen, he looked like the Murder of the Month Club selection for the sizzle seat. And the evidence was more than circumstantial: it was also self-confessional, or practically so. If Gillen wasn’t guilty, then Adolf Hitler had nothing to do with World War 2, as I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Howard alone in his office, adjacent to the temporary detention cell. It was 8 A.M. Howard never said much, and gave strangers the impression that the most important thing in his life was filing his fingernails. His left foot was usually draped over a corner of the battered desk, while a cigarette dangled from the right corner of his mouth. He smoked from mere habit, not because he liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gillen talk yet?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Made a sort of confession. Even thinks he may be guilty of killing his wife.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thinks!” I snorted. “Why, the guy was caught by two squad-car men as he tossed the carved torso into the river. Thinks! Why, the man must be nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard smiled lightly and examined his nail file like he had just discovered a convicting fingerprint. “I admit it looks like a wrap-up case,” he said, “but, Bub, you never can tell.” He called everyone “Bub”, from the chief of police to the newsboy on the corner. “Don’t forget that Gillen was drunk when caught.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is booze an excuse for killing your wife, or anybody else? It’s getting so that every man, or even woman, who gets in a jam with the law, tells the judge he has been drinking. And it’s never more than two bottles of beer. It’s time to change the record; that booze one is cracked.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Liquor is no excuse,” said Howard. “But men and women will do things under its influence that they wouldn’t have the nerve to do while sober. Gillen has not admitted that he killed his wife. He does admit that he carved up her torso and threw it into the river.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now that,” I said, “is very nice of him to admit. He’s just telling us what we already know. Did he have any more fairy tales?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard took three sheets of typed paper from his desk. “Here’s the official statement from the gentleman,” he said. “He was able to talk about 4 A.M.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-appearance-of-innocence&quot;&gt;The Appearance of Innocence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the confession. Briefly, Gillen stated that he and his wife, Mary, had been drinking in their small frame cottage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of the rare cool days when the Miami temperature went down to 40 degrees. They began to quarrel. Over what they argued he could not recall; probably over nothing, as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the small kitchen was a little potbelly iron stove. He put in some paper and charcoal and lit a fire. Then he went to a divan in the front room and fell asleep, his wife sitting in the rocker near the fire. This was about 4 p.m., as near as Gillen could remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He awoke about 11 p.m. His head was splitting and he was altogether groggy. He went to the kitchen, lit the light, and found his wife still sitting in the rocking chair.He called her a vile name; she did not answer. He shook her by the shoulders and she fell to the floor, motionless. He leaned over her and listened to her heart. There was no beat; he then knew she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I became scared,” he stated. “I knew the neighbors had heard as fighting and they would all accuse me of killing her. I don’t think I touched her, but I can’t remember very much. I knew the police would accuse me of murder. I just lost say head, and—well, you know the rest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed the confession back to Howard. “A very touching tale,” I said. “He could write some of that detective goo I hear on the radio. I still say he killed her, whether he knew it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The examination showed no signs of a blunt instrument on any part of her body,” said Howard. “No gun wounds or even knife stabs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean, no knife stabs? He carved her up, didn’t he?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“True, Bub, but there was no signs of one-shot knife stabs. It was all good, clean carving. At one time, the guy must have been a butcher, be was handy with a knife.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If he didn’t kill her, it was two other fellows with the same name. He had to admit he carved her up because he was caught with part of the torso in the bag. Right now he’s just playing the old game of Chair-Ducking, hoping to win life instead of the Big Jolt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard examined the file very carefully. “Look, Bub,” he said, “when you’ve been in this crime-chipping game as long as I have you’ll learn that a criminal investigator has two duties. One is to prove guilt and the other is to prove innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m not wholly positive that Gillen killed his wife before dismembering her body. Years ago, before the creation of modern criminal laboratories, Gillen would have been railroaded to his death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really knows how many innocent persons, men and women, have paid the extreme, official penalty for crimes they never committed. But times have changed, Bub; when a person wins a rope around his neck or seat in the One-Way Chair, you can make book that he is guilty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scratched my head and said, “Well, what are you waiting for now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doc Vollmer’s report. He’s been checking the remains and also the Gillen house.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I bet Doc says he’s guilty,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe so, but you may recall the Joel Hammond case. You had just come on the force, about ten years ago, and you were working in the uniform division. Well, Hammond appeared innocent, and even the first editions of the papers made him a burglar-shooting hero. But the morgue subject wasn’t a burglar. At the time Mrs. Hammond was vacationing in North Carolina with her parents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard put the nail file on the desk and went on. “The dead guy was named Raymond Nolle. Anyway, around midnight Hammond phoned Headquarters from his house and said he had just shot a burglar. We found a young man of about 30— who was Nolle—lying on the floor, with a .45 slug through his heart. It was a lucky shot. Hammond was still in his pajamas and his bed was disarranged, indicating he had been sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained to us that he had been sound asleep when a draft from the open window awakened him. Then he saw a male form in front of his bureau. He reached under his pillow, got his gun, and fired. Since he claimed he fired in the dark, it was a good shot. In fact, too damned good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard picked up the file and went to work on his right thumbnail. “Well, Bub, Hammond’s story sounded reasonable until I flashed a light into the eyes of the dead Nolle. I found that his pupils were very small; you know what that means?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It proved Hammond was lying. The lights were on when Nolle was shot. Moreover, he had been shot with planning and deliberation on the part of Hammond.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You mean the eyes of the dead Nolle showed you that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Exactly,” replied Howard. “In death, the size of the eye-pupils does not change. Nolle’s were very small, proving they had been contracted when he was killed. Light contracts, darkness expands. So I arrested Hammond for murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days later he confessed that he had asked Nolle to call on him, believing Nolle was having an affair with his wife. Subsequent facts proved his jealousy was both unfounded and silly. Dumb? Double dumb.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started for the door, stopped halfway and asked, “Do you mind if I call on Brother Gillen for a little chitchat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Help yourself. You’ll find him in the county jail, with his head in his hands, no doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;maybe-i-killed-her&quot;&gt;Maybe I Killed Her&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gillen sat on the edge of his cot, with his head in his hands. He was a stupid looking guy, with a half-moon head of hair—half hair, half bald. He told me he was 42 and worked, when he worked, as a carpenter’s helper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ever work in a butcher shop?” I asked. His green-gray eyes looked at me like that of a scared fawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nope; never worked in a butcher shop. Why ask that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Polite conversation. Skip it.” He covered his face with his hands and began to cry. Have you ever seen a full-grown man cry? It makes you feel kind of silly and yon begin to wonder if we’re not all babies in a pinch, no matter how old we get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe I killed her and maybe I didn’t,” he said, “so help me God, I don’t know!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next morning Howard called me into his office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your odds on murder hare flopped,” he said. “Horses and murders are usually bad bets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tossed the nail file in the air and caught it with his left hand. He was in excellent humor. The forehead wrinkles, which always crease his when he was working on a case, had vanished. “Doc Vollmer says Gillen never killed his wife, whether he thinks he did or not- And Doc knows his stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You mean Doc proved something that Gillen couldn’t prove himself?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is correct, Bub. Vollmer has proved that Gillen never killed his wife.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did Vollmer prove that it wasn’t Gillen who carved her up and tried to throw her into the river?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t try, Bub. That’s another angle and Gillen is guilty of the carving business. But—she was dead when he started to slice her. So he is not guilty of murder. You can’t kill a person twice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just how did the Doc prove it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By a spectroscopic examination of what was left of Mrs. Gillen. She died from carbon monoxide gas from the potbelly iron stove; it nearly got Gillen but he didn’t know it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What reward will he get for his carving ability?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d say ten years in the state pen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which is better than the Chair.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Much better,” said Howard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE END&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;im-no-surgeon&quot;&gt;I’m No Surgeon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Doc Welch thought it was thunder the first time he heard it. He sat up in bed, stiff, tense, listening for it again. And then, suddenly, a cold chill swept over him as he heard again, this time unmistaken, the three knocks at the front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife, Myra, grabbed his arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t answer it, Jim. Maybe, they’ll go away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room became suddenly blue-white as lightning fired the darkness. For an instant, he saw his wife’s face, pale and frightened and old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got to answer it, Myra. Might be someone pretty sick. Can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the thunder rumbled and again—three knocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wearily, Old Doc Welch stepped into a pair of slippers, threw a robe over his shoulders. His back ached and he wondered why he hadn’t become a lawyer or a plumber, instead of a country doctor. He stumbled past the waiting room to the front door, listened once more to the three knocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, all right. I’m coming. Hold your dang-blasted horses!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He switched on a small wall-lamp, opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shivering, cold rain lashing his face and body, Doc Welch stared at the two men in the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doc Welch?” It was the tall, shifty-eyed one who spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s right.” He opened the door a little wider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We got a little job for you, Doc. Little surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, I’m no surgeon. Broken bones, belly aches and babies. You fellows ought to see Doc Benjamin in town. He’s a surgeon.” He ran his hands through greying hair, started to close the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re a surgeon now, Doc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc Welch saw the gun, then. A .30 was clutched in the man’s hand, it’s shiny, blue barrel only a few inches from Doc Welch’s stomach. They forced the door open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Behave like a good, little doctor and nothing’ll happen to you. Get smart and we’ll blast you. Okay, Felix, go get the patient.” Felix, the short one, disappeared to a car outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc Welch backed up in the dim light of the hallway, studied the tall man, his eyes never for a second leaving the leveled .38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, why hadn’t he become a plumber? Plumbers were never wakened up at three in the morning to have a gun poked in their belly. All they had to worry about was pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc Welch turned then to see Felix and the “patient” in the doorway. Felix paused long enough to catch his breath, then he locked both arms around the “patient’s” chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grunting, his face red, he struggled and dragged the apparently unconscious patient into the hallway. Behind them, on the flowered carpet, lay a trail of rain and blood. The tall one slammed the door, never lowering the .38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Doc, take us to surgery. And no funny business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You fellows won’t get away with this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No sermons, Doc. Move!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hesitated, then seeing no choice, moved toward the white-paneled door. He opened the door and they were swiftly blanketed in darkness and the heavy scent of ether. That was when he got the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, Doc, put on a light.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait’ll I find the switch, will you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-fear-crazed-look&quot;&gt;A Fear-Crazed Look&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started toward the cabinets at the far end of the room. There was a jug of concentrated ammonia in one cabinet and if he could get his hands on it before the lights went on, throw it in their faces, it would blind them and choke them for a few seconds and a few seconds was all he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would soon find something else to throw, a chair, more jugs and bottles, and somehow he’d get a hold of that gun. He’d show them that being old and fat with kind, blue eyes didn’t make you necessarily harmless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, almost on tip-toes, he reached the cabinet. He reached down in the darkness, gripped the jug, started to unscrew the cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the stillness was broken by a muffled scream. He whirled, saw Myra silhouetted in the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, lady, stand where you are. C’mon, Doc, get that light on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no use to play it brave now. He didn’t want Myra stopping any bullets. Do what they said. At least he’d live—maybe. He cursed, angry that Myra had stumbled onto the scene, then switched on the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, lady, get over there with the Doc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She saw the gun, flashed a fear-crazed look at her husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, move!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Better do what he says, Myra.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She moved toward him in short, quick steps. He put his arm around her. Felix and the other man dragged their still unconscious friend to a table in the center of the room, lifted him onto it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, Doc, operate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-little-stomach-trouble&quot;&gt;A Little Stomach Trouble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shot a glance at his wife, saw the tears, the tremor of her lips, patted her gently, then moved reluctantly toward the table. He made a visual examination of the man on the table and in just a few seconds, he knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Looks like you’re a little late, boys. Your pal is dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now ain’t that something,” the tall one said. His dark eyes blazed. “Operate, Doc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Operate? For what? I told you this man is dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do like I tell you, Doc. Open him up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doc looked up, puzzled, saw the strange, twisted grin on the tall man’s face. Were these men crazy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe, you better explain to the Doc, Felix. Let him know what he has to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short man moved closer, waved his own gun at the dead man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seems our friend had a little stomach trouble, Doc. He swallowed some diamonds he shouldn’t have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc Welch still didn’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was going to take a little trip below the border — and with all them gems in his belly, too. Only we got a slug in his back and talked him out of it. Now open him up, Doc. They’re coated with plastic. You can’t miss them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, everything became clear to Doc Welch. He’d been in town that afternoon, stopped in the Waffle Shop for a cup of coffee, and there had run into the sheriff having a dish of his favorites. It had passed over his head at the time, but now he remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheriff had spoken of a big jewelry store stick-up. He’d said three men—$30,000 worth of diamonds. Then these were the same men the whole state was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned now, stared at the dead man. And this guy on the table had apparently tried to outwit the other two. He had coated the diamonds with some kind of plastic material, swallowed them one by one, hoping to escape by himself to Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for him, his pals had got wise and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Doc, we ain’t got all night. Snap it up!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Suppose I refuse?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Suppose you don’t.” The tall one’s teeth were bared in a murderous smile, as he waved the gun in the direction of the Doc’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a rack, he removed a white laboratory coat. At the table, he cut away the man’s shirt and undershirt, lowered his trousers, then covered him with a sheet. The two men backed over against the wall. The Doc could see they wouldn’t like this. He forced a pair of rubber gloves onto his hands, then went to the cabinet near the sink and removed what instruments he would need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paused over the corpse, the shiny, stainless-steel scalpel in hand, he took a last look at the two men standing in the shadows against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cut, Doc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc Welch began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-load-of-hot-gallstones&quot;&gt;A Load Of Hot Gallstones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clock hung next to the linen cabinet. It ticked away five, ten, fifteen minutes … and then, Doc Welch looked up. He couldn’t help feeling a sort of grim, professional satisfaction at a job well done. The incision had been made and he had found what he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doc, I got itchy fingers. Start picking them pellets out … and hurry!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With forceps and tweezers, the Doc began to remove the wet pellets. He laid them carefully in a large patch of gauze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later he removed the last pellet, stared at between fifteen and twenty pellets lying in the gauze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s all of ’em.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right, Doc, now you can take that plastic coating off the diamonds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long minute the Doc stood silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ll need some kind of a corrosive agent to take that plastic stuff off. Lye ’ll do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Only I don’t have any.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their eyes shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Heck, you can buy it in any grocery store.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, put the diamonds in a pan of lye and boil ’em for about five minutes. That should take it off and it won’t hurt the diamonds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two men avoided the corpse on the table. The tall one grinned victoriously and scooped the gauze into a bundle, stuffed the bundle into his coat pocket. Then he turned to the old doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You did good, Doc, and just to show you how much we appreciate it—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The butt of the gun came sudden like a whip, smashed against the Doc’s mouth, sent him sprawling to the floor. Myra screamed and ran to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“See you, Doc.” The tall one laughed, slapped at the gauze bundle in his pocket. “Wonderful surgeon, that Doc.” They were both laughing throatily as they left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc Welch didn’t speak until he heard their car grinding up the country lane. Then he turned his head, looked up at Myra. A slow, trickle of blood oozed from his pain- throbbed lips. Yet he smiled, and the smile became a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, Myra, I’d give a hundred dollars to see the look on them gunmen’s faces when they try to peddle a load of hot gallstones. Go call up the sheriff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” She was blinking fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why that fella there on the table had enough gallstones in his bladder to anchor a river boat. I just substituted the gallstones for the real pellets. Well, quit staring at me that way. Call the sheriff. Tell him we got every last one of them diamonds, and then put on some waffles. The sheriff is crazy about waffles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;trying-to-remember&quot;&gt;Trying To Remember&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sat alone in the darkness of the room. The night sounds of the city drifted up to him faintly. There was a cigarette between his fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had been sitting there a long time. It hurt him to move, so he was very still, trying to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he had touched the back of his head where the ache was. He had felt hair matted with drying, caked blood. His fingers had come away sticky. The pain started there and coursed down between his shoulder blades with steady, dull throbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sucked on the cigarette until it was limp, trying not to think of the pain, trying to remember … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had stumbled off the bed a half hour ago in a blind fog of pain. His groping fingers had located a light switch. He had looked once around the cheap, dirty hotel room. Then, because the light cut painfully into his burning eyes, he’d snapped it off and sat in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before that? Nothing. Nothing except that one clear picture. He closed his eyes and saw it again in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;all-he-remembered&quot;&gt;All He Remembered&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was beautiful, the girl. Her hair framed her pale, sensuous face in a shimmering black pool.he wore a loose satin negligee, black as her hair, dramatic against the milky white translucence of her smooth skin. Her full, sullen lips were parted slightly, showing a line of fine, even teeth. She was staring up at him without blinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could see himself looking down at her and thinking crazily that he was glad the bullet hole was in her temple so the hair would cover it. So that, even dead, she could go on being beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had bent, straightening the gold locket at her throat because he knew she would have wanted everything perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was all he remembered. Nothing before. Nothing after. Just the dead girl and this hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He finished the last cigarette he had found in a crumpled package in his pocket. He forced himself to stand up and to stay there until the waves of dizziness and nausea passed. Then to walk slowly to the light switch and press it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He kept his eyes closed for a long moment, letting the light filter through his closed eyelids, then slitting them gradually so his eyes grew accustomed to the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shuffled to the washbasin in a corner of the room, turned the dripping faucet on and sopped cool water on the back of his head. Then he dried his face and hands and stood before the bureau’s cracked mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;clayton-city-national-bank&quot;&gt;Clayton City National Bank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He saw himself for the first time. A strange face that he could not remember. He brought his fingers up, touching his lips, his cheeks. The reflection was that of a thin man in his late twenties. His complexion was pale as if he were seldom in the sunshine. There were dark smudges under his blue eyes, lines around his mouth. His dark brown hair was clipped in a short, crisp style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wore a rumpled sport coat, blue sport shirt and dark slacks. He raised his hands before his eyes, turned them over. They were slender and soft. The hands of an artist, an office worker, a druggist … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or a killer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision of the dead woman flashed before his eyes again. He tried to remember if there had been a gun in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, frantically, he searched his pockets. In the left patch pocket of his sport coat, he found it. A small, nickeled .25 automatic. He pawed at it with shaking fingers. In the firing chamber, there was an empty cartridge shell … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dully, he sat on the edge of the bed. Then went through the rest of his pockets methodically. He pulled out a wadded handkerchief, a comb, some loose change and a key ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his billfold he found twenty-two dollars in bills. There were no papers. Only a driver’s license and an empty business envelope addressed to “George Noles” in care of the Clayton City National Bank in Clayton City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Noles sounded vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t be sure that it was his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried to remember Clayton City and working in a bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“George Noles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He spoke the name aloud and jumped at the sound of his voice. It was an eerie experience, hearing your own voice for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stood up then and walked out of the room and down the dimly-lit stairway. An old man was dozing behind the hotel desk and he wanted to ask him how he had gotten into the room. But an instinctive fear held him back. If he had killed a woman, the police would be looking for him. He had to find out first who the dead woman was … and if he had killed her … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheap hotel was on a quiet, narrow street in a deserted part of the city. A few cars were parked at the curb in front. He took the key ring out of his pocket. Attached to it was a tag bearing the license number of a car and the name, “George Noles. Clayton City.” He didn’t recall having come in a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found a black 1940 model coupe with a license number that corresponded with the number on his key tag. One of the keys unlocked the door and he slid behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was when his foot struck the small leather satchel on the floorboards. In the dim glow from the dash-light, he opened it. He stared numbly at the bundles of currency that filled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With shaking fingers he took out one of the bundles. The paper band around it bore the name, “Clayton City National Bank.” There was in the neighborhood of ten thousand dollars in small denominations in the bag … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;good-evening-george&quot;&gt;Good Evening, George&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highway marker on the city limits of Clayton City said, “Population, 7,000.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a small, clean town nestling in the hills. A town where life was not hurried and a man could be contented or bored, according to his temperament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had taken George Noles—if that was his name—an hour of fast driving to reach Clayton City after asking directions from a filling station attendant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he drove slowly down Main Street, not knowing what to do next. He told himself he was a fool for coming back here. And yet, suppose he were innocent of any crime. Suppose he had a family here …waiting for him….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man lounging in the doorway of a drug store waved as his car passed. “Evening, George,” he called. Noles forced himself to wave back. Now he was at least sure that his name was George Noles and he was from this town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He passed the City Library at the end of Main Street. Something, an unconscious reflex, caused him to slow the car. He glanced up at the clock in the courthouse steeple, as if from force of habit. It was ten p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She’ll be getting off from work, now,” he said suddenly. He stopped the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had he said that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words had slipped from his lips automatically, formed somewhere back in the dark, locked chambers of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He parked the car. Got out and walked slowly up the wide concrete steps into the modern brick building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, even before he pushed through the glass doors, he knew what the librarian would be like. He knew that she would be blonde. That she would be a bit on the thin side. She wouldn’t be exactly pretty, but she would have serious brown eyes and a soft mouth and she would be nice to look at. She would be wearing a freshly starched dress and she would be sorting through her index cards with steady fingers until she glanced up and saw him and then her fingers would freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was like that. The color left her face. Her lips moved wordlessly. Then she looked down at her cards, but she wasn’t seeing them now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good—good evening, George,” she whispered with forced evenness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t know how to begin. What did you say? Look Miss, who am I? Have I just killed someone and stolen a large sum of money? Was I running away? Am I a thief and a murderer? Please tell me, Miss. You seem to be someone who might be a friend … who might help … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you said none of those things. You stood there, groping for words that would not come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;you-might-be-a-friend&quot;&gt;You Might Be A Friend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looked up again, at his strange silence. She glanced at his eyes, at his rumpled clothes, the blood on his coat collar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She paled and her fingers pressed whitely against the card box she was holding. Then quickly, efficiently, she went about the business of closing the library for the night. She locked her desk drawers, snapped the lights off, picked up her handbag. She took his arm, led him swiftly out of the building, down to where his car was parked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seemed to know the car. She got behind the wheel. He leaned against the cushion next to her, weak and spent, letting the night air wash over his sick face and cool the fever in his temples as she drove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t speak, waiting for him to begin it. He found it hard saying anything at all at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He began slowly, searching for the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A little over an hour ago, I woke up in a hotel room in Sanderton. I didn’t know who I was or how I got there. I couldn’t remember my name—nothing. A blow I had gotten on the back of my head seemed to have left me with a kind of amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I found a letter in my pocket with my name and this town on it. I drove back here and when I passed the library something seemed to make me stop … to tell me that you might be a friend … .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the darkness, her eyes were filled with many things. Incredulity, shock, pity … and something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s —let’s say we were once friends, George,” she whispered. “I—yes, I’ll help you if I can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He felt a growing dread of the truth he was trying to uncover. He felt that when he broke the dam that locked his past, a flood of evilness would wash his soul straight to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I—I don’t know your name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her voice was half a sob. “Mary. It’s Mary, George. You can’t—remember anything?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s like dim shadows on a wall. There—there was a girl. Very dark. Beautiful… .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Her name is Liss, George. Liss Denham.” Her face was like chalk in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. Yes, now I seem to know that.” He glanced at her, hating what he was doing to her and afraid of the knowledge that was slowly coming to him. But unable to stop now. He was walking straight into hell and he couldn’t stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do—do you think I might have had an argument with her? Do you think I—I might have murdered her?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Murder… .” She looked at him, her eyes wide and stricken. “George … I—why do you say….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I must see her, Mary. Can you drive me to where she lives?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-6&quot;&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;nightmare-became-reality&quot;&gt;Nightmare Became Reality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She nodded wordlessly. She swung the coupe around, into a side street. They drove silently along shadowy lanes and then parked before an apartment building. It was in a quiet, residential part of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apartment building, an old-fashioned three-story frame affair painted a faded yellow, stood in the middle of the block. He left the blonde girl in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His sick mind groped vainly for some shred of remembrance as he walked into the dimly-lit vestibule. A typewritten tab on one of the mailboxes told him that Liss Denham occupied apartment 3-A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked up the carpeted stairway. She did not answer the buzzer. He kept his finger on her doorbell as minutes ticked by. His hands grew sweaty and his stomach cramped with nausea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wished she would answer the door. That she would come out alive and unharmed and he would know the vision of her death was just the delirious dreaming of his sick mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she did not answer the buzzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went downstairs and around to the side of the building. There, he found a rusty fire escape. It went up to the third floor, past one of her windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He broke the teeth out of his comb, used the end of it to pry the screen hook loose. The window was not locked. He eased it up noiselessly, swung his legs into the room. Then he groped for the light switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found her in the living room … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exactly as his mind had pictured it. The small, cramped room with old-fashioned furnishings. The green and yellow flowered wallpaper that clashed with the red drapes. The parchment shade floor lamp spilling its light on the girl sprawled beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only, she wasn’t so pretty any more. Her face was waxen and pinched and her mouth was twisted in a grimace….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nightmare had become a reality. The gates of hell had swung wide now and he was walking right into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get away from here, George Notes, a thousand voices screamed in his mind. Take the ten thousand dollars and the car and don’t stop driving until you’re in South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t pry any more. Leave the past alone. It’s better that you don’t know who George Noles is or where the money came from or who Mary is or why this girl is dead … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-7&quot;&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;my-sister&quot;&gt;My Sister&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unconsciously, his hand had taken the .25 automatic from his pocket. He was staring at it and at the girl … his mind sick and reeling. So absorbed that he did not hear the key turn in the hall door or the padded footsteps behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He jumped when the voice said, “Drop the gun, Noles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly he turned, lifting his hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man standing there was short and stocky. He wore a wrinkled seersucker suit, tan-and-white shoes, a blue tie. His face was bland, expressionless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about him was neat, precise: his short, clipped mustache, his thinning strands of brown hair carefully slicked over his shiny scalp … the way his soft, fat white hand held a revolver pointed steadily at Noles’ stomach. He might have been a professional man, a doctor, lawyer, or a bank president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So you killed her,” he said, his voice shaking. “I warned Liss. Don’t trust that hick Noles too much. He isn’t as dumb as he looks, I told her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noles licked his lips. “Listen … .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can see how it was,” the man went on, trembling now. “You decided it would be nicer to have the whole fifty thousand …better than having Liss. She planned it all for you. You wouldn’t have had brains enough to open a tin piggy bank. But once you had the money, you started thinking a little under your own power. How simple it would be, you know, to have it all for yourself. So you killed her, you rotten hick. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” Noles cried. “Listen, I don’t know who you are or who this woman is. I—I don’t even know who I am. I woke up in a hotel room less than two hours ago, sixty miles from here. I had been struck on the back of the head. I couldn’t remember how I got there or anything before I woke up. All I could remember was this woman lying in this room. But I couldn’t have killed her…. I’m not a murderer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man’s eyes narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The old insanity business, Noles? It won’t work, Noles. Maybe with the police, not with me. Liss was my sister. I have more of a personal interest than the police … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-8&quot;&gt;Chapter 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;had-he-really-killed-her&quot;&gt;Had He Really Killed Her?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His pudgy white finger closed around the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell them you tried to kill me. That I caught you in the act of murdering Liss and you turned on me. I fired in self-defense. He raised the gun. His lips curled. “The town will believe anything of you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There it was again. What sort of man had George Noles been? What evil sickness had ruined him? Had it been this woman, Liss Denham?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Noles cried desperately. “I don’t know anything about any fifty thousand dollars. But I can prove I wasn’t taking that much money. Down in my car there is a satchel. There couldn’t be more than ten thousand dollars in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man shrugged that off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So you’ve hidden part of it. I’d hardly expect you to carry fifty thousand dollars in small bills around with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noles’ sick mind raced against time. He had to know all of it now. He had learned that his name was George Noles and that he had worked for the Clayton City National Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently Liss Denham had talked him into stealing fifty thousand dollars from the bank which they were to share. But what sort of power had she had over him? He must have loved her with an intensity that stopped at nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then had he really killed her? If he had loved her that desperately, he might have killed her out of jealousy. Or perhaps he had wanted the money more than the woman. He could have struck his head in a fall, running away from the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liss Denham’s brother raised the gun again. It would take him about two seconds to pull the trigger and send a bullet crashing into Noles’ heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His mind went back to that remembered vision of this room and the dead Liss Denham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, he saw the clear details. He saw himself kneeling beside the dead girl and arranging her locket. A foolish gesture … arranging her locket!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought crashed in his mind like cymbals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-9&quot;&gt;Chapter 9&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-head-strong-type&quot;&gt;The Head-Strong Type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that precise moment, the hallway door in the other room opened. There was the hurried tap of a woman’s heels and the blonde girl, Mary called, “George? I got worried. You have been here so long … .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stood frozen in the doorway. Her eyes were on the dead Liss Denham, her face a mask of stunned horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that brief instant, Liss Denham’s brother flicked his eyes in her direction and George Noles leaped. Every movement sent racking pain through his head. He flung himself on the short, balding man, hurling him back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They crashed into the wall, Noles’ shoulder ramming into Denham’s stomach. He got his hands on the man’s pudgy wrist and he twisted the gun loose. Kicked it across the room, then ducked after it, scooped it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denham had half slid down the wall, clutching his middle, his eyes rolling, face contorted as he gasped for breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noles waited until Denham got his breath back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now tell me all of it,” Noles said. “Start from when I met your sister. You see, I wasn’t lying when I said I don’t know anything that happened before two hours ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denham looked at the blonde girl, his lips curling. “Want her to hear it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noles hesitated, looking at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her brown eyes were dark smudges in her white face. “I—I guess I already know most of it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Denham talked in quick, short sentences. When he had finished, George Noles knew all of it. It wasn’t pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liss Denham and her brother, Avery, had moved to Clayton City six months ago. She’d visited the bank several times and Noles struck up an acquaintance. Soon he was infatuated with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He used all his personal savings, trying to keep up with her expensive tastes. Then she’d talked him into taking this money from the bank vault. With his knowledge of the bank procedure it had not been difficult. He had stolen the money tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denham finished, “I tried to talk Liss out of this but she was always the head-strong type. And tonight you killed her. But you won’t get away with it, Noles … .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-10&quot;&gt;Chapter 10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;you-killed-your-wife&quot;&gt;You Killed Your Wife&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Noles shook his head. “That isn’t all of it. You see there was one detail. The one thing I could remember clearly when I came too back in Sanderton, was this room. I saw Liss just as she’s lying here and that was when someone struck me from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The last thing I did before that person hit me, was to straighten a little gold locket Liss always wore at her throat.” He nodded at the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But you see, it’s gone now. Someone has been in here since that time. Someone who removed the locket, but did not report the murder, for good reason.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He moved toward Denham step by step. “I don’t think I killed Liss Denham. I don’t think it at all any more.” He stood before Denham. He ran one hand over the other man’s pockets in a quick motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denham began sweating. Little beads of it stood out on his lips. His eyes flitted like a trapped animal’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noles found the locket in Denham’s vest pocket. He snapped it open. Inside were pictures of Liss and Avery Denham and a fine engraving that read, “To Liss – from her husband, Avery”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You killed your wife, Denham,” George Noles said. “I must have come in and found her right after you did it. You hit me on the back of my head, planted the gun on me, took the locket off, then drove me to the hotel in Sanderton, left part of the money in my car and put me in a hotel room, hoping I’d be so frightened when I came too, that I’d run with what money I had. The police would naturally connect the theft with the murder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avery Denham panted, “That doesn’t prove anything. Just because she was my wife doesn’t prove I killed her!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police have something called the ‘paraffin test.’ With it, they can tell which one of us fired a gun tonight. I’m willing to take the test. Are you, Denham?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He reached for the telephone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denham’s breath was coming in short, ragged gasps. His shirt was soggy with perspiration. A dark ring of it had soaked through under the arms of his seersucker coat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She was going to leave me,” he whimpered. “The way it was planned, she was to get you hooked, talk you into stealing the money. Then we were to take all of the money and ditch you. But, damn her, she fell for you, and I’d rather have her dead than for someone else to get her … .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-11&quot;&gt;Chapter 11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;who-are-you-mary&quot;&gt;Who Are You, Mary?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Noles sat on the sofa with the blonde girl while they waited for the police. There was no fight left in Denham—slumped in a chair opposite them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denham had hidden all but the ten thousand dollars he had planted on Noles, but they would find that and give it back to the bank. Perhaps, Noles thought, they wouldn’t be too hard on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, his mind was clearing now, and he could remember scenes from this town. Shady lanes and the quiet, friendly laughter of neighbors. He could even remember walking to church on Sundays beside this slim, blonde girl, Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I—I may have to go to prison for a while. When I come back, I wonder if I might see you now and then,” he asked haltingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes were filled with that strange look … and with tears. She looked away from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Per—perhaps, George. We’ll see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who are you, Mary? What were you to me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started to speak, but didn’t. She had been dead inside for so long now, she couldn’t trust herself with emotions. She’d tell him later … or perhaps his mind would clear and he would remember …that she was his wife….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;pops-d-dead&quot;&gt;Pop’s D-Dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footsteps slapped the sidewalk behind me, pounding, running hard. A voice piped shrilly: “Pat—Pat, wait!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was excitement in the call. A touch of hysteria. I turned and saw a kid slamming toward me through the dusk, a kid of fourteen or fifteen. He wore dirty corduroy slacks, a baggy grey sweater and scuffed shoes. His sandy hair needed combing, and when he came closer I noticed streaks on his grimy face. As if he’d been crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t like Lester Harcourt to cry. At least I had never seen him do it, and I’d known him a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His pals didn’t call him Lester, they called him Butch or got punched in the jaw. He was that kind. A pretty tough little monkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look tough now, though. He grabbed at my arm, and I thought I saw panic in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pat!” he gulped. “Pat—” He gulped again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t interested in his panic. I wasn’t interested in anybody named Harcourt, period. He should have known that. There are some things you just don’t get over, and what his sister had done to me was one of them. “Scram, punk,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wouldn’t let go of my sleeve. “Pat, gee, listen!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Scram, I told you.” I didn’t like to look at his eyes. They were blue, like Barbara’s. They reminded me of her. Too much. And I didn’t want to be reminded of Barbara. I’d been more than two long years trying to forget her. And failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pat, you got to listen,” he said. That was the trouble with him. Persistent. Maybe because he liked me. Some kids are that way about cops. Hero-worship stuff. He choked: “It’s pop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s d-dead, Pat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-kid-had-really-told-the-truth&quot;&gt;The Kid Had Really Told The Truth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That stopped me cold. I’d never had anything against old Aaron Harcourt. He was a nice enough guy, as music teachers go. A little impractical, maybe. But he’d managed to bring up his two motherless kids on what he earned giving violin lessons. You had to respect him for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at Lester. “How’d it happen? Heart?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He … he was murdered, Pat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s true, Pat. I found him on the floor when I got home off my paper route just now. There’s blood on his head, and—and—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking. Fast. Not toward my apartment house just a few doors down the street, but the other way. The kid kept pace with me. I said: “Did you phone a doctor?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No. What good’s a doctor? He’s dead, Pat. I … felt him. His pulse, I mean. Then I came after you. I knew you’d be coming home from headquarters about now, and … you being a detective sergeant and all, I … I thought…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, okay,” I said. Then as we reached the corner: “What about your sister? Wasn’t she home?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No. I guess she already left for Moon Garden. She works out there now. Singing with Al Carlin’s orc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, so I heard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wish she’d married you instead of Rudy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped at the far curb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lay off, punk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even want to hear Rudy Ferranti’s name mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now shut up and come on. Quit needling me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned the corner and headed for his house, a shabby little cottage on a seedy lot in the middle of the block. I still couldn’t bring myself to believe his old man had been murdered. Nobody would have any motive for killing an inoffensive violin teacher. The kid had been reading too many detective stories. Or maybe this was his idea of a practical joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into the bungalow’s living room and saw Aaron Harcourt’s body sprawled on the floor, face down, the back of his head crushed in from a series of blows. Harcourt was all through giving music lessons. The kid had really told the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-terrific-struggle&quot;&gt;A Terrific Struggle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through the motions of putting my finger on the artery in his neck. I knew there’d be no pulse-beats. He was still warm, though. He hadn’t been dead too long. I crossed the room, picked up the phone, and called headquarters. “Pat Whitney talking,” I said. I reported the kill, gave the address, and was told to sit tight; the homicide boys would be right over with a tech squad. I rang off. Then I looked around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as upset as it was, the room was familiar. I remembered all the times I’d been in it in the old days, starting away back when we were all kids in grammar school: Barbara, the skinny, leggy tomboy. Al Carlin the studious one, wanting to be a musician. Me with my mind set on a blue-serge uniform and a badge. And Ferranti the flashy, wiry hellion who swiped oranges and bananas from his father’s fruit stand—and shared his loot with the rest of us. Whatever deviltry we got into, Ferranti was usually the one who started it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered another day I had come here, my first day as a probationary patrolman, showing off my shiny new shield, full of pride because I was finally on the force, a rookie cop. Strutting to make an impression on Barbara, who was no longer a leggy tomboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered how beautiful she had been that day, remembered how bright her eyes had been, remembered the soft golden sheen of her hair. That was the week Al Carlin got his first professional job with an orchestra. And it was the week Rudy Ferranti had come around flashing a thick roll of bills he’d won in a crap game. Almost a thousand dollars. Maybe I sensed, even then, what he would do to me later. What he and Barbara would do to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This very living room was where I’d asked Barbara to marry me. It was where she had said yes and held out her finger for the ring that had cost me two months’ pay. And it was where her father had told me, just a day before the scheduled wedding, that she’d eloped with Rudy Ferranti instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I was back again. And Barbara’s father was dead in a room that had been torn apart as if by a cyclone. The old man must have put up a terrific struggle before his killer battered him down. The worn rug was bunched, a rocking chair overturned. There was sheet music scattered all over. Ornaments and pictures had been knocked off a desk in a far corner. The place was a shambles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;a-genuine-enamieri&quot;&gt;A Genuine Enamieri&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a double cabinet photoholder in a hinged leather frame. The girl was Barbara in her white graduation gown, her first formal. The tall, studious-looking kid with the glasses was Al Carlin. The wiry, swarthy one was Ferranti. The big hulking guy with the lantern jaw and stupid expression was me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hurled it across the room. It landed near an open violin case that stuck out from under a window drape. The violin case caught my eye. It was a special kind, foreign-made and pretty old. I recognized it and turned to the Harcourt kid, who’d been watching me and not saying anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’s the fiddle that belongs in this?” I asked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His eyes widened. “Gosh, it’s gone, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seems to be. Take a look around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He prowled the room, then the rest of the house. He came back pretty quick. “I can’t find it, Pat. The one he gave lessons with, that’s in the hall closet. But this one—” He screwed up his face. “Any time pop took it out to play it, he always put it back in the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered the violin Aaron Harcourt had kept in this special case: an instrument he’d never allowed even his own kids to touch. Now and then, on some particular occasion, he would play it himself—but only rarely, and then to the accompaniment of a lecture as to its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A genuine Enamieri,” he would tell you dreamily. “A real one. Listen to the singing tone. The mellowness. The warmth. Andrea Enamieri, he was one of the great violin makers of Cremona. A pupil of the master Nicolo Amati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Enamieri and the more famous Antonio Stradavari were fellow-students. Together they learned their art. Today the public knows a good deal about Strad violins, but very little about Enamieri instruments. A pity, too, because in my opinion Enamieri was the better artisan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would look at you, waiting for you to say that this fiddle of his must be mighty valuable. Then he would sadly shake his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Valuable to me, yes. But to professional collectors, no. Because the Enamieri signature is not inside.” He would hold it up so you could look through the f-shaped holes on each side of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some time in its career it must have had an accident. The original back, with the signature on the inner surface, must have been splintered. It was replaced with this strip of lighter-colored wood. An excellent repair job, you understand. The tone is unimpaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ But that Enamieri signature would have made the difference between a violin worth perhaps a hundred thousand dollars and a concert fiddle you could buy for a thousand. If I were willing to sell for that price. Which I am not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lester blinked at me. “Pat, you think somebody murdered pop for that fiddle?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a theory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kid’s lower lip trembled. “Pat, I got to tell you this. I don’t want you to think I’m a stool, but—well, I got to tell you. Promise you won’t think that I’m just a blabbermouth, Pat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you care what I think?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aw, Pat,” he said. His voice wasn’t steady. “Don’t hold it against me because sis married that Ferranti guy. It wasn’t my fault she was a damned fool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lay off,” I snapped. “I told you I didn’t want you to mention him to me. I meant it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure, Pat, okay. Only—well, I wish you wouldn’t be sore at me for something sis did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m not. I’m not sore at anybody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-5&quot;&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;out-of-its-case&quot;&gt;Out Of Its Case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knew better, of course. He knew I was lying when I said I wasn’t sore. Kids are smarter than you give them credit for. He knew it was eating my heart out because Barbara had married Ferranti. He just didn’t know how to put his sympathy into words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pat, look,” he said. “I got to mention Rudy to you. Just this once. And I’m not ratting. Only after all, it’s my pop that’s been killed. That makes it different.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you trying to tell me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, things ain’t been going so good with sis and Rudy. All that talk of his about being in the chips, that was a lot of baloney. That was why he and sis came back here to live with Pop and me a couple of months ago. He was busted. Every cent he got his hands on, he dropped it on the ponies. Or dice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He scraped the worn rug with the scuffed toe of his shoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rudy wanted pop to sell that fiddle and lend him the money he’d get out of it. He kept telling pop he could take the dough and run it into a real bankroll in a hot crap game he knew about. Pop wouldn’t do it, though. You remember how pop was.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kid’s voice choked a little and his eyes went to his old man’s body. “Maybe he would have for sis, but not for Rudy. So he kept saying no. Rudy got pretty sore a couple times. He got nasty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How nasty?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Loud-talk nasty. Then sis went to see Al Carlin and landed a job singing with his band, out at Moon Garden. She said if Rudy wouldn’t work and earn her a living, it looked like she’d have to do it herself. Rudy didn’t like that too much. He spends most of his time out there watching to see that nobody don’t make no passes at her. He blamed it all on pop because he wouldn’t sell that violin. And now it’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m just telling you what I know.” He was tough again but it was only a cover-up. His lower lip was still trembling. “You make the guesses. You’re the copper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right,” I said. “I’ll make the guesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, not too many people had known about old Harcourt’s Enamieri. That narrowed the field down to his few intimate friends—and his immediate family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second place, an ordinary thief wouldn’t steal the violin out of its case, he’d take the whole works. But an insider might leave the case behind, closed and latched, hoping the theft wouldn’t be discovered right away. Figuring it wouldn’t come to light until the next time Harcourt went to take the fiddle out and play it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Now suppose the old man walked in, caught the guy taking the instrument from its plush-lined container, recognized him and jumped him. And got killed doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all meshed with what Lester Harcourt said about Rudy Ferranti. I went over to the phone, picked up the directory, leafed through it, located the number of the Moon Garden dance joint, and made the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Al Carlin,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently Carlin came on the line, his voice modulated and studious as ever. I told him it was Pat Whitney calling and he sounded glad to hear from me. Glad, and a little surprised. I congratulated him on having a dance band of his own and said: “Is Ferranti out there, Al?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled. “He’s always here when Barbara’s on the job. You want to talk to him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not on the phone,” I said. “In person. Be seeing you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rang off and said to Lester: “I’m going to pick up a taxi and go after him. You stay here until the homicide boys come. Tell them where I went.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went as far as the door. Then I said over my shoulder: “When the guys from headquarters get here, better tell them I want a squad car sent after me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Pat.” His voice was sullen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you can come along if they’ll bring you,” I added. After all, it was only natural he’d want to be around when his father’s killer was nabbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned then. “Thanks, Pat,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His eyes still reminded me of his sister’s. I went out of the house and didn’t look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-6&quot;&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;whered-you-get-the-fiddle&quot;&gt;Where’d You Get The Fiddle?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moon Garden was on the edge of town, just inside the city limits but a good mile beyond where the subdivision housing developments stopped. It was a rambling, ramshackle eyesore that masked its shabbiness with neon signs, including a big pale neon moon over the flat roof. The only thing that put it a cut above a juke joint was Al Carlin’s eight-piece orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hear the band braying something brassy as I headed toward the entrance. After two years I was going to see Barbara again. And I was going to put handcuffs on the guy who had taken her away from me. I was going to arrest him. For murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was going to hit Barbara hard, learning her old man had been killed. It would hurt worse, knowing her husband had done it. Knowing she was married to a murderer. She must have loved him or she wouldn’t have eloped with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she was going to lose him to the electric chair. Well, that was her tough luck. She wouldn’t get any sympathy out of me. In a little while she would find out what it meant to have your dreams smashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went inside. The place smelled like a pesthole. Tobacco smoke and the reek of stale beer eddied in the dim purple light, with brighter lights centering on the bandstand at the far end of the long narrow room. Along one side was a bar. The other side had booths and tables. All occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of teenagers were cutting up on the dance floor to the savage rhythm of Al Carlin’s crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlin stood downstage front, facing the orchestra, his back to the dancers. He gave the tempo and fiddled at the same time. Now and then he used his violin bow as a baton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked tall and tailored in his tux, and presently when the number was over he turned and gave the clapping crowd a nice studious smile, his glasses reflecting the colored footlights and his violin held in front of him, the bridge side turned in to his lean middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back of the instrument was smooth dark wood— except for a blond streak in the center. An insert strip the color of honey. The color of Barbara’s hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a sudden tightness in my throat. Then I shoved forward and found the door that led backstage. I came to the wings of the bandstand. I said loudly: “Al.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlin glanced my way, saw me and came to me. “You got out here pretty fast, Pat. Still looking for Rudy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I said. My voice didn’t sound like mine. My finger shook when I pointed with it. “Where’d you get that fiddle, Al?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This?” He twirled it. “Why? Do you recognize it? You ought to. It was Pop Harcourt’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t ask you that. I asked you where you got it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He frowned a little. He didn’t seem to like my tone of voice. “Is that you talking, Pat? Or is it your badge?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just answer my question,” I said. “Where’d you get the fiddle? Tell me and tell me quick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-7&quot;&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;i-believe-you&quot;&gt;I Believe You&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lifted a shoulder. “I bought it. From Rudy. He finally talked old man Harcourt into selling it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is that what he told you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure. I gave him three hundred for it. Three one-hundred-dollar bills. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then his eyes narrowed behind the glasses. “Hey, wait a minute, Pat. Are you trying to tell me there was something phony about the deal?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Something very phony,” I said. “Where can I find Ferranti?” Suddenly I felt tired, knowing what was ahead of me, knowing what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Barbara’s dressing room. It’s intermission time right now, and he’ll be in there with her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Show me the way,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He led me along a narrow hallway that needed ventilating. We came to a closed door and I shoved him aside. I opened the door without knocking first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara was sitting in front of her dressing table, touching up her makeup. Her hair was the color of honey and her face was the wistful little-girl face that had been haunting me these past two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trifle more mature, maybe. And there were tired lines around her eyes, I thought. But aside from that she’d hardly changed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither had Ferranti. Those swarthy, wiry ones never change. I saw him turn around, fast, and stare at me as I came in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferranti said: “Whitney!” and Barbara said: “Pat!” and I waved them both quiet. They looked at me. Barbara steadily and Rudy shiftily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said: “Your dad’s dead, Babs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her makeup was suddenly splotchy against cheeks that had gone white. “Pat—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was murdered,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started to get up off the bench in front of the dressing table but didn’t quite make it. She sank down again. She was trying to say something, but no words came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was killed for his violin,” I said. I wasn’t enjoying this. Maybe I should have enjoyed it, but I didn’t. I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What would you think if I told you your husband killed him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rudy jumped at me. He was fast on his feet. He always had been. He was fast with his tongue, too. He called me a name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sidestepped him and hit him in the belly. He gasped and went backward. He wouldn’t try that again for a while. I raised my voice and said: “Al, come in here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlin walked into the dressing room. He had the Enamieri in his hands. He went past me and shoved the instrument at Ferranti, “Take this and give me my money back, you creep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about,” Rudy said. He wouldn’t touch the violin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What money? Where the hell did you get that fiddle?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know where I got it. You sold it to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a lie!” Rudy yelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I paid you three hundred-dollar bills.” Carlin looked at me. “Why don’t you search him, Pat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did just that. I found the three bills in the side pocket of Ferranti’s coat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferranti said: “It’s a frame, a lousy stinking frame. I don’t know anything about—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The denial seemed to choke him. He scuttled to Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t let them do this to me, hon. They’re railroading me. Hon, I didn’t bump your old man. I don’t know anything about it. I swear I don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe you,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-8&quot;&gt;Chapter 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;to-pinch-rudy&quot;&gt;To Pinch Rudy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So she believed him. But that wouldn’t keep him out of the electric chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something else I was thinking about, something even bigger. Maybe when Barbara was a widow I might have another chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time maybe I could mend some of those dreams she’d smashed for me when she married Rudy Ferranti. I got out my handcuffs. The guy cringed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Barbara looked at him again the way she had never looked at me. It was something protective, something you couldn’t put into words. She knew him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loud-mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cheap flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was why she married him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was why she’d stick to him no matter what happened. Because he needed her. It had taken me a long time, but now I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I knew I wouldn’t send him to the chair. I could, and I’d love it. But I wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I realized he wasn’t guilty. I’d realized this for quite a while. I turned, took the Enamieri away from Al Carlin and snapped the handcuffs on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al choked and stiffened and rattled the cuffs. His eyes were hot and angry behind the glasses he wore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell is this, Pat, a gag? I didn’t kill pop—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, you did,” I said. “And it was the fiddle that tripped you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now wait, Pat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look,” I said. “You’re one of the few who knew pop owned an Enamieri. I think you were the thief he caught stealing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re nuts. I’m making plenty of money. Why should I steal a fiddle I could afford to buy? Besides, the kind of music I play these days, I don’t need an expensive violin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought of that,” I said. “But you used to be in love with Barbara, same as I was. And you hated the idea of her being hooked to a louse like Rudy. I think you stole the Enamieri to plant it on Rudy, so he’d be accused. So Barbara would be disgusted with him and maybe divorce him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was guessing, of course. But I must have been pretty close to the mark. Carlin’s expression told me that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said: “But pop caught you in the act. You had to kill him. So then I think you decided your original scheme would still work. Only better. Now you could frame Rudy for murder as well as theft. All you had to do was to slip three bills in the side pocket of his coat—where, incidentally, a guy never carries that kind of money loose. And then deliberately show off the Enamieri where I’d see it and recognize it. You’d say Rudy sold it to you, and you would have him nailed to the cross.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He did sell it to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said: “No, you slipped up on your logic there, Al. Whatever else Rudy may be, he’s smart. If he had murdered pop while stealing the violin, he would have ditched it. The dumbest killer in the world would have brains enough to realize that the fiddle was the one thing that would link him to the murder. His first instinct would be to get rid of it. Selling it to you was the one thing Rudy wouldn’t have done. He’d be putting himself in the electric chair for a lousy three hundred dollars. It wasn’t plausible. You were trying to frame him. I saw that right away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you make it stick?” he asked me. Not blustering. He really wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him I thought I could. And I meant it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All right,” he said. “I’ll take a plea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wouldn’t look at Barbara and Rudy when he said it. But I did. For the first time in two years I could look at them without hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Better start for home, you two,” I said. I was thinking there would be funeral arrangements to make. Details to be taken care of. “And—I’m sorry about pop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara said softly: “Thanks, Pat.” Just the two words. But they covered a lot of things. She and her husband went out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently a squad car of homicide guys came to take Al Carlin off my hands. They brought Lester Harcourt with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they took Al away he said: “But, Pat, I … I thought you were going to pinch Rudy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I almost did. I almost made that mistake.” He would never know how big a mistake I had come near making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But, Pat—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Skip it, Butch.” He got it. I’d called him Butch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put my arm around his shoulder. “Come on, Butch. I’ll take you home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-inquest&quot;&gt;The Inquest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his world tour, undertaken at the behest and at the expense of the Chinese Government, Song Kee found much to admire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this country, for example, he was impressed by a multitude of our ways and customs. And he frankly admitted their superiority over the Chinese equivalent or substitute of much that is distinctly American. In one respect, however, he contended that America was deficient in comparison with his own country. This was in the detection of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Occidental detective,” he stated one night in his precise, smoothly-spoken English, “is quite competent to deal with crime of the ordinary variety. It is when he approaches the unusual, the delicately subtle, that he is lost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And his inability,” he went on, “to handle successfully the extraordinary crime is due for the most part, I think, to his inability to believe in the unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police Commissioner Oglethorpe, who was one of the half dozen men lounging in the smoking room of the Travelers, smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It would seem to me,” he said, and his voice was mildly sarcastic, “that detection of crime depends less upon the detective’s powers of belief than upon his powers of observation and his ability to uncover facts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee shrugged his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Facts, my dear Commissioner,” he replied, “are the bane of your Western civilization. You are a very young people. It will be several centuries before you learn that facts are not necessarily truths. Had I a secret, I would hide it —not under a bushel of lies—but under a bushel of facts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner turned away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yet Judges and juries have an odd predilection for facts,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which they, too, often mistake as sign posts towards Truth,” was Song Kee’s parting shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was some weeks later that New York was startled by the murder of Irene Grenville. She was an actress who had attained an unusual prominence partly because of her real histrionic ability and partly because of the strange tales of her private life which circulated throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always there had been stories about her. Even in her early days, when she had played small parts in an uptown stock company, whispers about her wildness and depravity had crept to the ears of those who knew her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she climbed higher on the professional ladder the whispers had become louder and reached a greater audience. When at last she reached stardom she was known from the Battery to the Bronx as the wickedest woman on Broadway, that street popularly supposed to be a cesspool of iniquity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she had been found dead in the public hall of the hotel she had called home. A knife had been thrust into her lovely bosom. And all New York clamored to know the identity of her murderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essential facts brought out at the coroner’s inquest were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophie Mallory, a chambermaid in the Ralston Hotel, where the deceased had lived, stated that at seven-fifteen on the night of the murder she had been standing at one end of the public hallway on the fourth floor. She was occupied at the time with the sorting of soiled linen, preparatory to sending it downstairs to the laundry. She had seen Miss Grenville leave her rooms. Closing the door of her sitting-room, which was near the end of the hall where the deponent was working, the actress walked rapidly down the hall toward the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question by the Coroner:—Except for yourself, was the deceased alone in the hall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—No, sir. A man was coming toward her from the other end of the hall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question:—How far apart were they when you last saw them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—About five or six feet apart, sir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question:—At that time had the man reached or passed the deceased?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—Neither, sir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question by the Foreman of the Jury:—Did you recognize the man?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—No, sir. Not then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chambermaid went on with her story. This was to the effect that she had resumed her task of sorting the linen, turning her back on the hall where Miss Grenville and the man were walking. But hardly had she turned and started her work before she had been startled by a shriek of agony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terror-stricken, she had turned back to the hall. There she saw the deceased lying on the floor. The man was bending over her. She had run to them and found Miss Grenville dead—stabbed through the heart. And the man bending over the body she had recognized as Mr. George Grover, a young man who had a suite on the floor above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question:—Did Mr. Grover say anything to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—No, sir. Not to me directly, sir. But he kept repeating over and over, “Good God! She’s dead! She’s dead!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophie Mallory was excused. The next witness was Detective Sergeant Delaney of the Branch Detective Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaney spoke in the calm, unemotional tone of a man to whom giving testimony in court is an ordinary occurrence. He stated that he had gone to the Ralston Hotel on the night of the murder in response to a telephone call from the management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had found Irene Grenville dead. She had been stabbed through the heart. The dagger was still sticking in the body. Among the people gathered around the dead woman he had spoken to Sophie Mallory and to George Grover. After he had heard the chambermaid’s story, he had arrested Grover on suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And besides,” he volunteered, “the man looked like he had done the trick. He was white and shaking like a leaf.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further he testified that with the permission of the coroner he had removed from the body of the deceased the fatal dagger and taken it to headquarters to be examined for fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question:—Were there fingerprints on the dagger?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—There were.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question:—Can you state whose?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness:—I can. They were the fingerprints of George Grover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next witness was Marie Thibault, an excitable Frenchwoman who for many years had been maid to Miss Grenville. All that she had to tell was that George Grover had been acquainted with her mistress and that there had been some bad feeling between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I cannot say what was the matter,” she said. “All I know is that the last time Monsieur brought Mad’moiselle home from the theatre, Mad’moiselle, she say to me, ‘Marie, nevaire let me see that crazy man some more’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hush fell over the court-room when, accompanied by a uniformed policeman, George Grover entered. He was a young man of rather pleasing demeanor, carefully but quietly dressed. In normal circumstances he would have passed anywhere without causing remark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now his face was pale and his eyes gleamed with a feverish excitement. His suppressed emotion gave to his not distinctive features an expression interesting and at the same time provocative of sympathy. As he took the witness stand a woman in the rear of the court-room cried out faintly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave his testimony in a quiet, subdued manner, speaking without emphasis or intonation like a man talking in his sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After answering the usual formal questions as to name, address and occupation, which last he gave as student of Oriental languages, he said that on the night of Miss Grenville’s murder he had gone down the stairs from the fifth floor to the fourth of the hotel to keep an appointment he had had in the apartment of Mr. Sito Okawa, an attaché of the Japanese embassy. Mr. Okawa had promised to lend him a book on certain Japanese myths. Yes, he had seen Miss Grenville and had bowed to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What happened then?” the coroner asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I passed her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coroner smiled incredulously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You passed her?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I passed her. I had just taken a step or two when she cried out. Before I could turn she had fallen to the floor. She was dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coroner hesitated a moment, regarding Grover steadily before he asked his next question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you touch the dagger with which she was stabbed?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grover shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I did not,” he stated in the most impressive tone he had used thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then how,” the coroner leaned far over the desk to ask the question, “do you account for the undeniable fact that your fingerprints are on the handle of the dagger?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With bated breath the occupants of the court-room awaited his reply. It came in a low, despairing voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I cannot account for it,” the witness answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coroner leaned back in his chair. When he spoke again it was almost indifferently, as though he were asking the question as a matter of form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Had you and the deceased quarreled?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The witness shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Quarreled, no,” he answered. “Once I ventured to suggest to Miss Grenville that she was ruining herself by the kind of life she was leading. She resented what she called my interference and told me that she did not want to see me again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, almost languidly, he left the witness stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more witness remained to be examined. This was the Mr. Sito Okawa with whom Grover claimed to have had an appointment. He was a short, dapper Japanese of the extremely intelligent type, suave, polite to the verge of the ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After bowing low to the court and to the jury he took the witness stand. He stated that on the night of the murder he had indeed had an appointment with Mr. Grover. To the best of his belief, however, the time when they were to have met in his rooms had been eight-fifteen rather than seven-fifteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the coroner sent the jury to their deliberations. These did not consume a great deal of time. In less than five minutes, the twelve men were back in their places, the foreman ready to recite their verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was what everyone had expected. Irene Grenville had come to her death from the blow of a dagger driven into her heart by one George Grover, whom they recommended should be held to await action by the Grand Jury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days later the Grand Jury indicted the unfortunate young man. He was taken to the Tombs to await trial. And after a week or so New York forgot all about him, being concerned with matters of newer and greater importance. The baseball season opened—and a quite scandalous performance, the work of a degenerate French playwright, was being run at one of the largest theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-plea&quot;&gt;The Plea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee’s participation in the Grenville murder case came about in a singular manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night as he entered his club for dinner after an afternoon unprofitably spent in investigating the administration of the city’s poor-laws, the doorman told him that a visitor was awaiting him in the Ladies’ Room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A visitor for me?” Song Kee inquired, lifting his eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir. A lady, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee turned slowly and entered the Ladies’ Room. There, standing before the onyx fireplace of which every member of the Travelers, is justly proud, stood a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was young, handsomely gowned and beautiful. Her loveliness was not of the gorgeous, riotous sort which startles one into instant admiration, but gentle, modest like the beauty of a wild-flower, appealing not to the many but to the appreciative few. Song Kee bowed low before her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You wish to see me, madam?” he asked with smiling courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you Mr. Song Kee?” The woman put her query in a voice of amazing fulness and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At your service, madam.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again Song Kee bowed almost to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman stood silent before him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seemed on the verge of speech, but hesitated as though in search of adequate words. Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Kee. I am in frightful trouble. I—I have come to you to ask your help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My help, madam ? Why I—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know,” she interrupted, “you do not even know who I am. Still,” she paused, “I am Sylvia Granger. I was engaged,” she threw her head up proudly, “I still am engaged to marry Mr. George Grover.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee’s brow puckered into a puzzled frown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman looked at him in amazement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Surely,” she said incredulously, “you must have heard of Mr. Grover. He is accused of the murder of Miss Grenville.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look of comprehension dawned in Song Kee’s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah, yes,” he said, “the actress in the Hotel Ralston. I read of the case in the newspapers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wave of emotion swept over the woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, Mr. Kee!” she cried. “He didn’t do it. He couldn’t have! I don’t care what they say—he couldn’t have!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She brushed her hand across her forehead, swaying backward. Song Kee sprang forward and helped her into a chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, Miss Ganger,” he said gently after a moment during which she had regained her self-control, “please tell me as calmly as you can why you have come to me and what it is that you wish me to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman looked him full in the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want you to help me to prove George Grover innocent,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she hurried on as though to forestall any possible refusal from Song Kee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you remember some weeks ago here in this club, you and Mr. Oglethorpe had a discussion about the detection of crime? You stated your belief in the superiority of the methods of your own people. My brother happened to overhear the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He repeated it to me. And I am here, Mr. Kee, to beg, to implore you to use those methods in which you believe to investigate this frightful crime which has drawn into its net someone whom I hold dear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You,” her voice was tremulous with despair, “you are my last hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little Song Kee remained silent, staring contemplatively at the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he rose and began to pace the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Miss Granger,” he said at last, pausing before the woman whose eyes did not falter beneath his steady gaze. “In China men are taught to respect certain things as sacred. One of these is the faith of a good woman. I respect your faith in your fiancé’s innocence. I am inclined to do my small best to help you justify it.But tell me what it is that makes you so sure of Mr. Grover’s innocence. As I recall the evidence brought out at the inquest, it was strongly against him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/the-unbelievable2cap.svg&quot; alt=&quot;She brushed her hand across her forehead, swaying backward.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Chinaman’s words a gleam of hope had come to Sylvia Granger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She leaned forward eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have no facts to justify my faith, Mr. Kee,” she said, “but I have what is worth innumerable facts—my knowledge of the man I love. You have said, or implied, that I am a good woman. I believe—I hope I am. But this I know. I know that in my heart no man, were he ever so clever, could have reached the place George Grover holds were he capable of imagining, let alone committing, the dastardly crime of which my fiancé is accused.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee had listened carefully to her. When she had finished he resumed his pacing to and fro, stopping from time to time before her and gazing down at her with unseeing eyes. He paused at last with the manner of one who has arrived at a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Granger breathed, “You will help me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was more a prayer than a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee wrenched himself away from the thoughts which had absorbed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” he said, “I will help you. But do not expect too much. All that I can do is to promise that I will look into this case as thoroughly as my poor abilities will permit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Granger sprang to her feet. “Thank you! Thank you!” she cried. “And whether you succeed or whether you fail to save George, please know that you will always have my gratitude and my friendship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which should be more than enough reward for any man,” Song Kee said, smiling as he bowed her out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-evidence&quot;&gt;The Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who left his rooms on a side street off Madison Avenue was a far different Song Kee from the quietly dressed, well-poised man of the world who had promised help to Sylvia Granger at the Traveler an hour or so earlier. His clothes, his linen, his hat—a brown derby with an exceedingly curly brim— were of the fashion of Broadway rather than of Fifth Avenue. His shoes were of a gorgeous tan, contrasting gaily with pale lavender socks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in keeping with his clothes, the man himself had changed. The dignity which ordinarily characterized his manner and expression was gone. In its place was a sort of childishly good-natured meekness, not unattractive but in a way almost ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hurried westward until he had crossed Eighth Avenue. Midway in the block he paused before the doorway of the Branch Detective Bureau. He looked up at the lighted windows and smiled to himself. Not long ago when his study of American customs and methods had led to an examination of the Police System, he had been a familiar and not unpopular figure in and around the old brownstone building. Often since then he had looked back with pleasure to the nights spent in the back room where the boys gathered and passed the time in spinning yarns of their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moment later Song Kee entered that back room. He was greeted clamorously by its occupants. Laughing and joking he crossed to the table where a big man sat, his chair tilted back against the wall, his hat pulled forward over his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello, Mr. Delaney,” Song Kee said in purring, good-natured tones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big man looked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, dog-gone it, if it ain’t a Ching- a-Iing! How’s your soul, you yeller heathen ? Wha’d’y’ want around here ?” Song Kee took the man’s rough greeting in good part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do I want?” he laughed. “Maybe I want to hear Mr. Delaney tell about the Grenville murder.” Delaney glanced at him suspiciously. “Say, what’s your interest in the Grenville case?” he asked belligerently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, nothing much. I just promised a friend I’d look into it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaney spat disgustedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, you’ll be wastin’ your time. The case is an open and shut thing. Grover’s the guy, and we got him. That’s all there is about that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought perhaps—” Song Kee began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aw, fergit it.” Delaney interrupted. “The Grenville dame was croaked and Grover done it. He was caught with the goods, wasn’t he? Didn’t the chambermaid see him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, according to the papers she didn’t actually see him stab the woman.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Naw. But she seen him near the woman just before she was stabbed and that’s enough for me. Besides, didn’t we find his fingerprints on the dagger and he himself says he never touched it after it was in the woman. Then he must have touched it before, mustn’t he ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee shook his head meditatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I—I suppose so,” he said, “still—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaney pushed back his chair violently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aw, say, you! You make me sick —always buttin’ in where you ain’t wanted. You—” he paused. Then his manner changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Say,” he went on, “some of the boys around here think I’m sore on you because of that little mess we had awhile ago. Now just to show ’em the kind of guy I am I’ll make you a proposition. If you think you can get anythin’ out of this here Grenville case I’ve missed, go to it! Go as far as you like and I’ll help you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee’s mild eyes gleamed with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You mean that. Mr. Delaney?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I said it, didn’t I?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee pulled up a chair and for a quarter of an hour the two men talked in whispers, Song Kee speaking quickly and excitedly, Delaney listening and making replies in the tolerant manner one uses toward a child. Then they got up and left the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took the Subway downtown to Headquarters, where on Delaney’s authority Song Kee was permitted to examine the dagger through the agency of which Irene Grenville had met her death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an oddly shaped weapon, with a long handle roughly carved, tapering toward the blade. There was no guard dividing handle and blade. The blade was of an unusual narrowness, shaped like an enlarged bodkin, very sharp at the point, duller at the sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Delaney standing impatiently by. Song Kee favored the deadly instrument with a long examination. Twice he laid it back on the table and turned away from it. But something about it seemed to fascinate him and he returned to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last he drew a small rule from his pocket and measured it with great exactness, noting down the measurements on the back of an envelope upon which at the same time he made a most detailed drawing. Then he said to Delaney—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is there any proof that this dagger belonged to Grover?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not as I know of. We didn’t bother about that. The fingerprints were enough for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What did he say about it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aw, of course he denied ever seein’ the thing before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, he would do that,” Song Kee said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He picked up the dagger again, holding it by the blade, the end of the handle thus pointed at the detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wonder,” he said, “why there should be all those little notches along the top of the handle ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaney glanced at the weapon indifferently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why shouldn’t there be? Ain’t it carved all over?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, but—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee stopped and smiled at the detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe I’m just imagining things, Mr. Delaney,” he said, leading the way from the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the doorway of Police Headquarters Song Kee paused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Delaney,” he said, “did you find any motive for the killing of this Grenville woman either by Grover—or by anyone else?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaney puffed at a cigar he had just fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I figure it this way. Grover was in love with the dame. And he was what I call a ‘one-woman-guy.’ But the ‘one-woman-one-man’ stuff didn’t go with Irene. Anything that wore pants and packed a wad of bills looked good to her. Grover got sore and—woof!” Delaney made an expressive gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But Grover said—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fergit it, kid. I know what Grover said—but—well—” And Delaney winked broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Song Kee devoted to the curious pursuit of reading old newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From publication office to publication office he went, going through the files of the morning and evening dailies. He himself could not have told exactly for what he was searching. But he kept on looking, and toward nightfall in a journal noted for its news of the theatrical world he found an item which intrigued him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surreptitiously he cut it from the paper, and preserving it carefully in his pocketbook, quietly hurried away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He journeyed uptown to his rooms. For a long time he sat motionless by the window staring unseeingly into the street. His face was as devoid of expression as that of a wooden Indian. Only his eyes were alive and they shone with a lively interest and an intense concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly an exclamation broke from his lips. He jumped to his feet and with the quickness of thought changed into a dinner jacket and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took a taxi to the Ralston Hotel and sent up his card to Mr. Sito Okawa. After a few moments’ wait, he was asked to ascend to the apartment of the Japanese attaché.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found the room to which he was admitted in some disorder. Open suitcases were on the floor. A half-packed English kit-bag stood on a chair against which leaned a strapped bundle of umbrellas and canes. In the centre stood Okawa in an embroidered jacket, smoking as he directed his valet in the business of packing. He came forward to greet Song Kee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There ensued an exchange of courtesies in which only two Orientals could seriously indulge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My business, Mr. Okawa,” Song Kee said, “is of small importance—a question about a Mr. Grover whom I believe you knew.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sito Okawa made a gesture of sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah, that poor young man,” he said in tone of deepest melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You believe him guilty then of the killing of this dancing woman?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I?” Okawa shrugged his shoulders. “I believe nothing, really. How should I? All I know is what the papers printed about the unfortunate affair. But your question, my dear friend?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Quite so,” Song Kee answered briskly. “It is about the appointment he is said to have had with you on the night of the murder. Are you quite sure it was for eight-fifteen rather than seven-fifteen as he has stated?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okawa contemplated the end of his cigarette consideringly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure, Mr. Song Kee?” he said at length. “How can we be sure of anything in this most remarkable world? Still, I have the distinct impression that the hour set for our meeting was eight-fifteen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When did you make this appointment ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That same day at luncheon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee sighed deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The poor fellow,” he said. “I’m afraid there is nothing one can do for him. I have tried, but—” he sighed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he pulled himself together and extended his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is most good of you to have received me so kindly. I will relieve you now of my troublesome presence, as I can see that you are busy.” He pointed to the half-completed packing. “You are leaving town?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tomorrow or the next day,” Okawa replied. “My duties at the legation will require my presence in Washington. And I prepare for the possibility of a sudden start.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee made his adieux. He bowed low and still lower backing toward the door. In his passage he stumbled against the bundle of umbrellas and canes leaning against the chair and knocked them with a clatter to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His apologies for his awkwardness were absurdly profuse. He picked up the things he had knocked down and stood fingering them nervously while he called himself several kinds of a clumsy, ungainly fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okawa smilingly waved the apologies aside and relieving him of the bundle accompanied him to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee looked out into the hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was just here in front of this door that the tragedy occurred, was it not?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okawa shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, my friend. A few feet further toward the elevator. There—just beneath that electric globe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee advanced to the spot indicated. Slowly Okawa followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinaman stood silent for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So,” he said finally, “the dancing woman was about here, going in the direction of the elevator?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And Mr. Grover came along about here,” Okawa turned around so that he faced Song Kee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little Chinaman seemed to have forgotten Okawa’s presence. His eyes traveled slowly, as though measuring distance, down the hall. They stopped at a point on the wall perhaps twenty feet away. Then he smiled contentedly as one quite satisfied with the progress of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discreet cough from Okawa brought him to himself. He turned and again thanking the Japanese for his courtesy, hurried off down the hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the desk downstairs he drew the clerk aside and presented a card bearing Delaney’s name and a request to the hotel management to give the bearer what assistance he might require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell me,” he said, “who occupied the room four doors down the hall from Mr. Okawa on the night Miss Grenville was killed?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clerk consulted the guests’ list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That will be room four-thirty-eight. The room was empty that night,” he announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And when rooms are empty are they left unlocked ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a rule, no. But the maids are sometimes careless. We cannot watch all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the room opposite?” Song Kee asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s see. That is Count Angellotti’s bedroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you,” Song Kee said as he turned away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a smiling and somewhat excited Song Kee who stood at the entrance of the hotel and consulted his watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hurried to a little Chinese restaurant on Fourth Avenue where he indulged in strange dishes with stranger names never printed on a Chinese-American menu. Then he dashed into the subway and was borne swiftly southward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came to the surface of the Bridge. He journeyed north on Park Row until it changed into the Bowery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he turned into a side street leading through a ravine of ill-kept tenements toward the East River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a house not far from the corner he stopped. He descended into the basement and knocked vigorously on a black, greasy door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute or so later, the door was opened ever so slightly and from out of the darkness gleamed a pair of slanting eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee said a few words in a southern Chinese dialect and was admitted to the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Take me to your most respected master,” he said in the same tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His guide led him along an evil smelling hall, up a flight of rickety stairs ending in a sheet metal door. With a key which dangled at his waist the guide opened the door and drew aside for Song Kee to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room Song Kee entered seemed only an ante-chamber to still another apartment. It was empty, but through a door at the rear could be heard the sound of many voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait here,” the guide said with great respect, “and I will call my master.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He disappeared into the inner room, returning shortly with another Chinaman. He was a man of many years whose emaciated frame was accentuated by the long plum-colored robe which hung in loose, rich folds from his shoulders. When he recognized his visitor he bowed almost to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You do my poor house great honor,” he said in a thin, quavering voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee drew near and spoke in low, peremptory tones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aged Chinaman bowed again. Then he turned to the servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Go,” he ordered, “to the barbarian they name the ‘Rat’ and say to him that I would borrow the tools of his trade for an evening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes later Song Kee left the house carrying in his pocket a ring of strangely shaped keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He returned to the Ralston Hotel. This time he did not enter through the main doorway which faced the Avenue but through a lesser entrance on the side street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unconcernedly, he strolled through the corridors until he reached a stairway leading to the upper floors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was quite certain that he was unnoticed by any of the hotel employees he ran quickly up this stairway until it curved around the elevator shaft and he was free from observation. Then he made his way more slowly until he reached the fourth floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the hallway in which Irene Grenville had been killed he moved cautiously until he reached a certain doorway. A great sigh of relief came through his parted lips as, looking up, he saw that the transom was dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As quickly as though he were a professional thief he drew the ring of oddly shaped keys from his pocket and tried them one by one until the lock beneath his hand turned. Softly as though stealing into a chamber of death, he stole into the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His errand within took him no more than five or perhaps ten minutes to complete. Then as silently and as cautiously as he had entered, he withdrew, relocking the door behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he did not come away empty handed. Under his loose coat he clung firmly to something, holding it eagerly as though it were of great value to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not caring now whether or not he were seen, he walked boldly down the hall and waited for the elevator, which a moment later bore him to the main corridor below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now his hurry and excitement were over. What he had set out to do he had accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leisurely he turned his steps homeward. At a corner drug store he stopped, and spent a few moments telephoning. A half hour later he was in bed sleeping as quietly as a tired child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle no_toc&quot; id=&quot;the-proof&quot;&gt;The Proof&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning at eleven o’clock five people were gathered in Police Commissioner Oglethorpe’s office at headquarters awaiting the coming of Song Kee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner himself sat at his desk going through his morning’s mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Sergeant Delaney stood beside the window looking down into Centre Street and talked in subdued whispers to a representative from the District Attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a far corner sat Sylvia Granger beside her fiancé, Grover. They did not talk, but just sat there hand in hand waiting expectantly*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At five minutes after the hour, Song Kee was ushered into the room. He was immaculately garbed in morning coat, striped trousers and patent leather boots. In one hand he carried a silk hat in the latest mode, in the other a cane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Delaney saw him, he gasped. In dress and manner he was so different from the little Chinaman who used to lounge in the backroom of the Branch Detective Bureau, tolerated for his good nature and his generosity in the matter of fairly good cigars. His surprise was changed to awe when he saw the Commissioner rise and greet the Chinaman with the respect one shows to an equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee bowed low to Miss Granger and the Commissioner. He greeted Delaney with a genial wave of the hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he hung his hat on the Commissioner’s rack and leaned his cane carefully against it. These details attended to he seated himself comfortably in the centre of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I must apologize for keeping you all waiting,” he said, “but my taxi was delayed—a little argument between my driver and one of your excellent traffic policemen. But now that I am here we can proceed at once with the matter in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are all here,” he continued, “at my request. Be assured, I would not have sent for you had the affair not been urgent. I have done three things—proved the validity of certain statements I once made to you, Mr. Oglethorpe; given Miss Granger the help she asked for, and taken advantage of Mr. Delaney’s offer to ‘go to it’ if I thought I could discover anything he had overlooked in the Grenville murder case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A half suppressed snort from Delaney interrupted him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Mr. Delaney,” he said gently, “I have found several little things which you overlooked—one of which is the real murderer of Irene Grenville.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Granger started from her chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then—then—” she began, but words failed her and she sank back beside Grover, her eyes fixed doubtfully upon the Chinaman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Miss Granger,” Song Kee said smiling across the room, “Mr. Grover is as innocent as you or I of the Grenville woman’s death. In a few moments I think I shall be able to convince these gentlemen of that fact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, you’ll have to go some, young man,” the rather officious Assistant District Attorney put in. “The evidence we have—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Would be enough to convict the Commissioner himself,” Song Kee laughed, “if wrongly applied.” He paused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can see that you, like Mr. Delaney, have been taken in by facts. And as I told Mr. Oglethorpe once when we discussed these matters, facts are not always sign-posts to the truth. The clever criminal will conceal his crime beneath misleading facts, rather than lies. In this case the criminal chose to create facts pointing to the guilt of another. And to use a phrase of your delightful slang, ‘you fell for it’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aw, fer the love of Mike, get on.” This from Delaney, sotto voce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee overheard him. “Very well, Mr. Delaney, I will ‘get on’.” He turned to the Commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Oglethorpe, you will recall that my complaint about the Occidental detective concerned his inability to believe in the unbelievable. That applied in this case. Mr. Delaney here, who, by the way, is an efficient man, was convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that Mr. Grover was guilty of the murder of Irene Grenville. He was taken in by the facts presented—the ‘almost’ eye-witness to the act—the fingerprints on the dagger. When I suggested to him that perhaps another might have killed the dancing woman, he laughed at me. The idea was beyond belief and as such he would not believe in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delaney clenched his unlighted cigar more firmly between his teeth and muttered, “Yes, and I’d like to see the guy that could.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, I’ll admit,” Song Kee continued, paying no attention to the interruption, “that Mr. Delaney did not have the incentive that I had to believe in the unbelievable. He had not had the pleasure of meeting Miss Granger nor had he drawn inspiration from her faith in her fiancé’s innocence. So—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But to go on. I started to work from the point of view that the accused man was innocent. Therefore someone else must have committed the crime. But who? To find that out was my task. And at the outset I was very much at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I went to see my friend, Mr. Delaney, But he could do little to help me. His opinion, you see, was—well, prejudiced. However, through his kindness, I found out the names and all there was to know about the occupants of the rooms on the floor where the dancing woman had lived. Then, this information was of little use. One and all they were beyond suspicion. Then Mr. Delaney brought me down here and showed me the fatal dagger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here was something interesting, and, it seemed to me, important could I but see it. It was a queer knife—very long with a straight handle running into a needle shaped blade. And there was something else peculiar about it. The top of the handle was carved with little notches and they were not in keeping with the carving on the rest of the handle. Also they were newly cut. Why? I could not answer—then.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee paused. His audience was silent, tensely, eagerly waiting for him to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My next clue. I found in the files of one of your daily papers.” he went on. “I knew of no other place to seek the identity of someone who might desire Miss Grenville’s death. But I reasoned that in some column of stage and Broadway gossip I might find something to put me on the track. I did. It was only a tiny paragraph, but it gave the reason why someone—someone I knew of—might kill the dancing woman.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It merely related the return to his own country of a young foreigner whom she had ruined—in honor as well as in pocketbook. This young foreigner came of a family that holds its honor very dear. And by a strange coincidence, the young man’s brother had an apartment on the same floor with the woman who had dragged in the mud the honor of his family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Say, you don’t mean the dago count, Angellotti ?” Delaney shouted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee held up his hand. “Patience,” he said; “we’ll come to that later.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In China,” he resumed, “we have a saying to the effect that truth grows out of thought and concentration. I applied it. In my rooms I gave myself over to meditation. I had found someone who might have desired the death of the dancing woman. If I could discover a way in which he could have killed her, I might be making progress. And after a little, I did discover a way. From out of the realm of my subconscious mind there flashed an idea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the Grenville woman had not been stabbed at all —but shot? What if the instrument were not a dagger—but an arrow ? Then I remembered that the people from whom the foreigner was sprung had been the world’s greatest archers since the tenth century. Also I remembered the freshly cut notches on the handle of the knife—notches which might be used to catch in the string of a bow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stopped and glanced around the room. The impression he had made on his hearers was one that would have satisfied an actor most avid for attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oglethorpe and the Assistant District Attorney were listening intently. Sylvia Granger and her lover, whose hand she still held, were leaning forward, their eyes glowing with excitement. Even Delaney, the skeptic, had dropped his pose of indifference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My next step was to visit the scene of the crime to discover—well, if the thing could have been done as I had imagined. And incidentally I paid my respects to Mr. Sito Okawa, a most courteous gentleman. That visit was productive of several things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was the knowledge of exactly where the dancing woman had been when she was killed. And standing where she had been, I saw the place from which an arrow could have been shot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Delaney had given me the approximate angle at which the knife had been driven into the body and this angle corresponded to that which would have obtained had the woman been killed by an arrow shot through the open transom of a room twenty-five feet down the hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I left Mr. Okawa and questioned the clerk of the hotel. He told me that on the night of the murder the room in question had been unoccupied. The room opposite was the bedroom of Count Angellotti.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then it was the dago you suspected?” Delaney again broke out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee smiled softly upon the now thoroughly excited detective. He seemed about to answer him. Then he changed his mind and said, “Will you pass me my cane, Mr. Delaney?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Grover,” he said when Delaney had handed him the cane, “have you ever seen this cane before ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He held out the bamboo stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grover started in surprise. The seeming irrelevance of the question dazed him for an instant. Then he looked closely at the cane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why, yes, I think so,” he said hesitatingly. Then: “Yes, yes, I remember. It’s—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Song Kee stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sh!” he said quickly. “Would you mind writing the name of its owner on that slip of paper on the desk beside you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Grover obeyed, he went on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, gentlemen, I must confess to a slight infraction of your laws. The next thing I did was to provide myself with some skeleton keys. Armed with these I again visited the fourth floor of the Ralston Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the room I unlawfully entered I found that for which I searched. I found the bow that had driven the arrow into Irene Grenville’s breast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He answered the question in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are wondering what I did with it. I brought it here. It is here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He held out the cane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a deft movement he pulled at the handle. It came out of the bamboo stick. And the handle was the hilt of a long, evilly shaped knife, the blade of which had been hidden in the hollow of the bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This,” he said in explanation, “is the arrow which brought death to the dancing woman. Through the kindness of Mr. Delaney I was able to borrow it this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And this,” he bent the long stick of bamboo, “is the bow. String it with a piece of cord beyond the joints at either end and you have a deadly and effective weapon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait a minute—wait a minute,” Delaney shouted. “I beg your pardon, Mr. Commissioner, but let’s get this thing straight. D’ye mean to say Mister Song Kee, that some guy who had it in for the Grenville woman hid in the vacant room and potted her when she went down the hall?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pretty fishy! But we won’t say nothin’ about that. Maybe though you won’t mind tellin’ me, if this cock and bull story of yours is true, how Grover’s fingerprints come to be on the knife?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee smiled patiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How did your own get there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mine—they never were there!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee smiled again, but less patiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Listen, Mr. Delaney. Just a few moments ago I asked you to pass me my cane. You did so, giving it to me by the handle. Now, providing someone who touched it after you, wearing gloves and touching it only at its very end, had pulled it from its sheath and using it as an arrow had shot it into a body—whose fingerprints would then be on it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughed outright at the expression on Delaney’s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t blame you,” he said, “for your surprise. “We are dealing in this case with a man who was very subtle—a man who manufactured, not lies, but facts, to cover his crime. One must marvel at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Patiently, he waited and studied the habits of the woman he had come to kill. He found that she invariably left her apartments on her way to the theatre promptly at seven-fifteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He arranged that someone should be in the hall at that time on the night he intended to murder her. He even arranged that the fingerprints of that person should be upon the weapon he was to use. This he contrived by the very simple method which I have just now used to convince the skeptical Mr. Delaney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Read, Mr. Grover, the name of the murderer on the slip of paper you are holding in your hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a trembling voice, Grover read the name he had written in compliance with Song Kee’s request that the identity of the owner of the cane be set down on paper rather than spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sito Okawa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now tell us when and where you last saw Mr. Okawa’s cane.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the restaurant at luncheon on the day of the murder. It was the occasion upon which we made the appointment to meet in his rooms that night. He was leaving without it. When he remembered it, and as I was nearer to it than he, he asked me to hand it to him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which you did—and left your fingerprints on the handle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee rose and bowed like a showman finished with his exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At once everyone in the room began to talk, plying him with questions. The jangling of the telephone brought a tardy silence. Commissioner Oglethorpe answered it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes? Good God! Go on, go on! He left a note? Read it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oglethorpe hung up the receiver with a bang. He turned to his companions and said gravely; “Sito Okawa killed himself in the Ralston Hotel last night. A note was found beside his body saying that he had killed Irene Grenville to avenge the dishonored name of his family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone except Song Kee and Delaney stared fixedly at the Commissioner. Delaney was watching the Chinaman, who was standing unmoved and unperturbed, looking out of the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Say, Mr. Song Kee,” the detective said grimly. “What did you have to do with this last?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Kee shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps nothing—perhaps everything,” he answered. “I don’t know. Last night when I went to his room I left a message. It was to the effect that it would be unfitting that the person of one of the Samurai be held in bondage and punished by foreigners even in the enforcement of their laws. It may be that he understood.”&lt;/p&gt;
