&lt;p&gt;The class of fiction which we shall group under this head must include all stories where the problem is invented and solved by the author and set forth in such a way as to give an astute reader opportunities for guessing or reasoning out the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An actual detective need not necessarily figure in the story, but detective work must be done by some of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be crime or apparent crime or attempted crime. But whether the problem is one of murder, robbery or kidnapping,—whether it be solved by evidence, deduction or a cryptogram,—it is detected, not guessed, and this is the main element in our classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average or typical Detective Story of to-day is the detailed narrative of the proceedings of an individual of unusual mental acumen in unraveling a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, a detective is a member of the police organization or of a private detective agency. But for fictional purposes he may be such, or he may be any one with what is called &quot;detective instinct&quot; or a taste for detective work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that in its earliest days the word &quot;detective&quot; meant merely a shadower or follower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A curious old story in &quot;Harper&#39;s Magazine&quot; for 1870 begins thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The remarkable skill and penetration shown by our modern detectives in &quot;shadowing&quot; suspected persons until sufficient proof has been obtained to warrant their arrest is illustrated by the daily history of crime. By the term &quot;shadowing&quot; is meant that vigilant watch kept upon the culprit by some one who follows him like his own shadow, and to do this successfully indicates no small degree of skill on the part of the &quot;detective.&quot; This last expression recalls to memory some strange facts which came to my knowledge in the early part of my life, and I can never meet the term in print or hear it in conversation without a painful reminiscence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story goes on to relate the harrowing experiences of a criminal who was shadowed by the ghost of his victim, and ends thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Such is the story in connection with the first use of the term &quot;detective,&quot; and I never meet it, either in voice or in print, without thinking of Captain Walton, and the fearful retribution unfolded in his history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this old story is not a Detective Story according to our classification, it is a simple Ghost Story. It is only of interest in referring to the earliest use of our word &quot;detective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rise-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;Rise of the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Detective Story as we know it was first written by Poe, yet he never used the descriptive word, nor was Dupin a detective, either professional or amateur, for when Poe wrote his immortal Dupin tales, the name &quot;Detective&quot; Stories had not been invented; the detective of fiction not having been as yet discovered. And the title is still something of a misnomer, for many narratives involving a puzzle of some sort, though belonging to the category which we shall discuss, are handled by the writer without expert detective aid. Sometimes the puzzle solves itself through operation of circumstance; sometimes somebody who professes no special detective skill happens upon the secret of its mystery; once in a while some venturesome genius has the courage to leave his enigma unexplained. But ever since Gaboriau created his Lecoq, the transcendent detective has been in favor; and Conan Doyle&#39;s famous gentleman analyst has given him a fresh lease of life, and reanimated the stage by reverting to the method of Poe. Sherlock Holmes is Dupin redivivus, and mutatus mutandis; personally he is a more stirring and engaging companion, but so far as kinship to probabilities or even possibilities is concerned, perhaps the older version of him is the more presentable. But in this age of marvels we seem less difficult to suit in this respect than our forefathers were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, meanwhile, that, in the Riddle Story, the detective was an afterthought, or, more accurately, a deus ex mach- ina to make the story go. The riddle had to be unriddled; and who could do it so naturally and readily as a detective? The detective, as Poe saw him, was a means to this end; and it was only afterwards that writers perceived his availability as a character. Lecoq accordingly becomes a figure in fiction, and Sherlock, while he was yet a novelty, was nearly as attractive as the complications in which he involved himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Story writers in general, however, encounter the obvious embarrassment that their detective is obliged to lavish so much attention on the professional services which the exigencies of the tale demand of him, that he has very little leisure to attend to his own personal equation—the rather since the attitude of peering into a millstone is not, of itself, conducive to elucidations of oneself; the professional endowment obscures all the others. We ordinarily find, therefore, our author dismissing the individuality of his detective with a few strong black-chalk outlines, and devoting his main labor upon what he feels the reader will chiefly occupy his own ingenuity with,—namely, the elaboration of the riddle itself. Reader and writer sit down to a game, as it were, with the odds, of course, altogether on the latter&#39;s side,—apart from the fact that a writer sometimes permits himself a little cheating. It more often happens that the detective appears to be in the writer&#39;s pay, and aids the deception by leading the reader off on false scents. Be that as it may, the professional sleuth is in nine cases out of ten a dummy by malice prepense; and it might be plausibly argued that, in the interest of pure art, that is what he ought to be. But genius always finds a way that is better than the rules, and it will be found that the very best riddle stories contrive to drive character and riddle side by side, and to make each somehow enhance the effect of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention of the above paragraph will be more precisely conveyed if we include under the name of detective not only the man from the central office, but also anybody whom the writer may, for ends of his own, consider better qualified for that function. The latter is a professional detective so far as the exigencies of the tale are concerned, and what becomes of him after that, nobody need care,—there is no longer anything to prevent his becoming, in his own right, the most fascinating of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Poe&#39;s or Gaboriau&#39;s stories, appeared the &quot;Memoirs of Vidocq.&quot; This work, thought by many to be largely fiction, is the history of a clever villain who became a detective, though never called by that name. He was a Secret Agent, and is called on his own title page. Principal Agent of the French Police. His memoirs are old-fashioned, dull and uninteresting, but they show glimmerings of the kind of reasoning that later marked the Fiction Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Gaboriau was the first author to use the terminology, since become so familiar, of detective, clues, deduction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe ascribed to his Dupin, &quot;analytic ability,&quot; and this is all that is claimed for the conventional detective of fiction, though perhaps more acutely described by Brander Matthews as &quot;imaginative ratiocination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe goes further in saying Dupin&#39;s work was &quot;The result of an excited or perhaps a diseased intelligence.&quot; This statement may have mirrored the author&#39;s own mind, for, while making no assertion. Professor Matthews observes that he should understand any one ho might declare that Poe had mental disease raised to the nth power, and we have long since been told that &quot;great wits are sure to madness near allied.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-detective-fictive-and-real&quot;&gt;The Detective: Fictive and Real&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is this very principle that marks the difference between the detective in fiction and in real life. The cleverest detectives in life are not men of diseased intellect, however greatly developed may be their powers of ratiocination. It is just that touch of abnormality, of superhuman reasoning, that makes a Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the work of the fiction detective is always successful. Naturally, because his work is planned to this end by the author. The fiction detective plays his game with marked cards. Though seemingly groping in the dark, he is walking a definite path laid straight to a definite end. He is pushed off on false scents, but pulled back and set right again by an adjusting power which does not exist in the case of real detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the sooner the writer of detective fiction realizes that the detective of fiction has little in common with the detective in real life, the better is that author equipped for his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real detective, for one thing, is rarely a man of culture or high ideals. The fiction detective is usually an aristocrat, unfortunately impoverished, or working at his art for art&#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real detective, however great his analytic ability, often finds that he cannot apply it to his case. The fiction detective never has this experience; he finds his case ready made and perfectly fitted to his powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real detective finds little or nothing in the way of useful material clues. The fiction detective finds his properties laid ready to his hand at the right moment. Dropped handkerchiefs, shreds of clothing, broken cuff-links, torn letters,—all are sprinkled in the path ahead of him, like roses strewn before a bride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Nature lends a helping hand to the favored detective of fiction. Usually &quot;A light snow had fallen the evening before.&quot; This snow is declared by credible witnesses to have begun at one psychological moment, and stopped at another; thus allowing the inevitable display of footprints of certain sizes, shapes and superimposition. Indeed the laws of nature are willing to give way, at need, and vegetation takes on unusual qualities to help along the good work. Sherlock Holmes continually finds his indicative footprints on turf or grass plot, and of course the criminal is identified at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real detective seldom if ever finds these helpful footprints at the right time and place. In case of his need of them, the obstinate ground is hard and unimpressionable; or the snow is melting and shows only oblong holes; or the grass refuses to present a clear and definite impression; or even if fairly respectable muddy footprints appear on a nice, clean, hard-wood floor, they are so incomplete in outline that they might have been made by any well-advertised shoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criminals and suspects in fiction must presumably wear shoes made for the purpose, with flat level soles that touch the floor at all points and leave an exact working diagram, instead of a shapeless blotch with ragged edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly with finger-prints. Though carefully impressed in incriminating places by the fiction criminals, in real life they are rarely found where they can be of use. The finger-prints found on the discarded empty frame of the Mona Lisa have not yet led to the recovery of the picture; whereas in fiction they would long ago have put the thief behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the fiction detective is not a real person, any more than the fairy godmother is a real person; but both are honored and popular celebrities in the realm of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if one would realize the immense superiority of the fiction detective for fiction purposes he has only to read any of the occasionally published &quot;true detective stories,&quot; or even those which are founded on actual cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiction-versus-fact&quot;&gt;Fiction versus Fact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, old-fashioned family papers published stories, beneath whose titles a line in parenthesis read, &quot;Founded on fact.&quot; Such tales were invariably uninteresting, and at last the editors learned not to publish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true tale of a criminal problem and its solution is uninteresting because it is not planned to be interesting. The technique of the detective story calls for the same kind of planning and preparation on the part of the author as does a successful act of legerdemain. The prestidigitator takes a rabbit out of a silk hat, but unless he had planned for it beforehand he couldn&#39;t do it. What he might take, unplanned, out of the hat,—its leather band or gilt stamped lining,—would be of no interest to his audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the old-fashioned or the inexperienced author who thinks that an incident which has come within his own experience or that of his friends, is necessarily available for a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Gelett Burgess&#39; celebrated Bromides is, &quot;Now this thing really happened!&quot; And it is a fortunate writer who escapes the occasional, &quot;I&#39;ve something to tell you about my neighbor&#39;s mother-in-law; I know it to be true, and you can have it for one of your stories!&quot; The enthusiastic generosity of the speaker causes his face to glow with the delight of &quot;helping an author,&quot; and how can you tell him that not one in a million such anecdotes would be of use to you, and that moreover, your head and note-book are both crammed with material of the right sort waiting to be used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your helpful friend makes no claim save that his story is a fact, and he can never understand how apt is this quality to bar it from fiction. He can never understand the difference between fact and truth—truth, the wide universal element that must be adhered to; and fact, the petty and narrow incident that is rarely of interest, and often indeed contradicts truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realism, according to its American master, Mr. W.D. Howells, is nothing more than the truthful treatment of material; and in Mr. Howells&#39; hands this treatment has produced writings of absorbing interest. But it is an equally truthful treatment of material that appears in the Social and Personal column of the Miller&#39;s Comers Weekly Gazette, or in the Congressional Record, yet we are not interested in either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the plot of a Detective Story, or in the mental makeup of the detective, realism finds little place—as much as you wish in the material details, in the clues, the inquest, or the suspected butler, but the key-note of the story itself is that of pure fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must seem to be true as fairy stories seem true to children. You must persuade your readers to believe it, as Peter Pan wheedled his audience into believing in fairies; but &quot;Founded on Fact&quot; or &quot;Elaborated from the Records of a Real Detective,&quot; is fatal to the interest of a Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the argument ring true, let the accessories be realistic, let the situations be logical and the conditions plausible; but let the magic of the unreal detective tinkle through it all as fairies dance in real moonlight. Sustain the interest by a subtly woven chain of events that leads unerringly to the climax in a way the uncertainties of real life can never do. Lead your readers on to the re-solution of the problem, whose terms have been stated in logical sequence straight through the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uninitiate say, &quot;You&#39;re so fond of detective stories, I suppose you read all the murder trials in the newspapers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, a true lover of detective fiction never reads detailed newspaper accounts of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should he? He reads detective fiction for the enjoyment of the complete and finished entertainment therein provided. The statement of the problem, the interesting development, the breathless chase after false clues, the never tiring return to the right track and the final rounding up of the explanatory solution—he knows when he starts he will be disappointed in no particular. Every mystery will be explained and the fun is in trying to explain them himself. As an antagonist at chess, he pits himself against his opponent, the author, and endeavors to foresee and understand his feints and maneuvers. But to whatever degree he succeeds in this, a complete revelation awaits him at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life a criminal case reported in the papers gives no assurance of ultimate solution, gives no assurance that all the developments are intentional and go to make up a complete and harmonious whole; that the whole story is so balanced and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;poised, so coherent and interdependent as to give only satisfaction to its readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, the Detective Story of fiction is art; the accounts in the newspapers of the crimes of the day are merely the truthful treatment of material; and the latter, unless seen through the medium of an artist, is not of interest to the lover of the Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another argument against realism in this field of fiction, is the fact that from the nature of its plot the details of a Detective Story are often unlovely. The newspapers delight in realistic description of the gruesome elements of crime. The Detective Story writer in the interests of his art glosses these over, not only because they have no necessary bearing on his theme, &quot;The riddle and its solution,&quot; but because they jar on the reader&#39;s taste and disturb his economy of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, whose imagination was beyond all bounds, thus speaks of realism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The defenders of this pitiable stuff uphold it on the ground of its truthfulness. Taking the thesis into question, this truthfulness is the one overwhelming defect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An original idea that—to laud the accuracy with which the stone is hurled that knocks us in the head! A little less accuracy might have left us more brains. And here are critics absolutely commending the truthfulness with which only the disagreeable is conveyed! In my view, if an artist must paint decayed cheeses, his merit will lie in their looking as little like decayed cheeses as possible!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, the writer of detective fiction pictures as much cheese and as little decay as he may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tale of horror, or of gruesome interest, which not only paints the decayed cheese with realism, but with exaggeration, is not a Detective Story, it belongs in another class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all this applies to Detective Stories which are constructed in harmony with the unwritten but inexorable laws which require the aforementioned qualities. To be sure, plenty of Detective Stories are written which violate every requirement of true technique, but these are not in our argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is well discussed by Mr. Cecil Chesterton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have read hundreds of such tales which made excellent reading so long as the mystery subsisted, but of which the conclusion was unspeakably weak and far- fetched and in some cases absolutely unintelligible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing is more irritant in a detective story than that even one mysterious circumstance should remain at the end unexplained. Yet the writers appear to imagine that it is quite sufficient if they have thought of some sort of explanation of the central mystery, while a hundred attendant facts, introduced solely to puzzle or mislead the reader, are left without even a suggestion to illumine them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed the conclusion ought to be not merely plausible, but in a sense inevitable. The reader ought not indeed to expect it, but he ought to feel afterwards that he ought to have expected it. To explain the problem at the last moment, as is often done, by introducing new circumstances at which he could not possibly have guessed, is merely to leave him labouring under a half-conscious sense of injury and resentment, and rightly so, for he has been cheated into attempting to solve a puzzle which, as it turns out, was for him quite insoluble. In an ideal detective story all the clues to the true solution ought to be there from the first, but so overlaid as to pass unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If anyone wishes to see how this can be done, let him read attentively the first two or three chapters of &#39;The Moonstone1, by Wilkie Collins. Here the all-important conversation between Franklyn Blake and the doctor is given at length, but in such a context as to appear a mere incident designed to throw light on a phase of Franklyn&#39;s temperament.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently there has been published a book of short true Detective Stories. (&lt;em&gt;Adventures of the World&#39;s Greatest Detectives&lt;/em&gt;, George Barton.) These are of so little interest as to be almost unreadable. The preface says, &quot;Crime in itself, is painful and sometimes repulsive, but a study of the methods of criminal investigation by which difficult problems are solved and the guilty brought to justice is entertaining and may be profitable. &quot;While the foregoing is true, the study of the methods of criminal investigation is not entertaining to the reader, unless written as literature,—indeed, as fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple description of a crime and the methods pursued in regard to its investigation make dry reading. The setting, the characters, the atmosphere, of a well-constructed story are necessary to make it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preface we quote goes on to state frankly that the detectives they tell about, work in the most prosaic manner imaginable, but they somehow manage to get results, and that is what counts in the police world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have merely facts. Their work doubtless is prosaic, but a prosaic account of it entertains nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at one of the stories of this book. It begins thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One crisp December morning Louis Hanier, a Frenchman, the owner of a little wine shop on West Twenty- sixth street in New York City, was found dead in the hallway of his home. The bullet of a .38-caliber revolver was discovered in the man&#39;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He had been murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, and suppose he had been. Outside of the impulse of common humanity, the reader has no interest in Louis Hanier. This is not the reader&#39;s fault. He cannot be expected to have an interest in a mere name. But the author of detective fiction will arouse such an interest in the reader&#39;s mind before announcing the murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we are informed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem was to find the man who had committed the crime—to pick him out of the millions of people in New York City. The newspapers were filled with the horrible story. The coroner&#39;s inquest attracted the usual crowd of morbid-minded people. The minor police officials became very busy—and accomplished nothing. After the hysterics were over, the puzzle finally made its way to the one man in New York City who had the genius and persistence to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, as stated, rouses no thrill of expectancy. There is no cause for interest, wonder, or curiosity. It is all &quot;The truthful treatment of the material,&quot; and has no art in presentation or implication. Now we come to the description of the detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a few minutes the door opened and a strong, well- built man with square shoulders shambled into the room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He had gray hair, a thick nose, blue eyes, a smooth face and a perpetual smile. He glanced about him in a furtive way and realized that he was in the presence of the triumvirate of talent that ruled the under-world of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He squared himself as a man would who was preparing to be on the defensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commonplace description of a commonplace man, which does not in the least provoke our desire to know more of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, through the dull and prosy story, we read the uneventful proceedings which led to the conviction of the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never would Detective Stories have a vogue if they were written thus. But it is not so much the presence of the facts as the absence of the fiction that is the trouble. The plain unvarnished statements leave us no room for expectation, no reason for surprise. Detective Stories are not built around truthful incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another volume of &quot;True Stories of Crime&quot;, by Arthur Train, gives us this foreword:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The narratives composing this book are literally true stories of crime. In a majority of the cases the author conducted the prosecutions himself, and therefore may claim to have a personal knowledge of that whereof he speaks. While no confidence has been abused, no essential facts have been omitted, distorted, or colored, and the accounts themselves, being all matters of public record, may be easily verified. The scenes recorded here are not literature but history, and the characters who figure in them are not puppets of the imagination, but men and women who lived and schemed, laughed, sinned and suffered, and paid the price when the time came, most of them, without flinching. A few of those who read these pages may profit perhaps by their example; others may gain somewhat in their knowledge of life and human nature; but all will agree that there are books in the running brooks, even if the streams be turbid, and sermons in stones, though these be the hearts of men. If in some instances the narratives savor in treatment more of fiction than of fact, the writer must plead guilty to having fallen under the spell of the romance of his subject, and he proffers the excuse that, whereas such tales have lost nothing in accuracy, they may have gained in the truth of their final impression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories in this book may be interesting to a lover of human documents, but to the reader of &quot;Detective Stories,&quot; they are dull and prosy, except where &quot;the writer fell under the spell of romance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-interest-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Interest of the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe says, in speaking of the writer&#39;s plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A skillful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents—he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no word written, of which the tendency direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established design. And by such means, with such care and skill, a picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it with a kindred art, a sense of the fullest satisfaction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest of the Detective Story depends entirely on its rousing the reader&#39;s curiosity. Every detail of its plan must sustain and heighten an intense determination to know the solution of the riddle; and as this curiosity becomes keener, and this determination more inflexible, so much more necessary is it that the explanation shall be adequate and satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this result cannot be achieved if the author undertakes his work in the spirit shown by the authors of &quot;The Wrecker&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne, when they say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We had long been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of the police novel or mystery story, which consists in beginning your yarn anywhere but at the beginning, and finishing it anywhere but at the end; attracted by its peculiar interest when done, and the peculiar difficulties that attend its execution; repelled by that appearance of insincerity and shallowness of tone, which seems its inevitable drawback. For the mind of the reader, always bent to pick up clews, receives no impression of reality or life, rather of an airless, elaborate mechanism; and the book remains enthralling, but insignificant, like a game of chess, not a work of human art. It seemed the cause might lie partly in the abrupt attack; and that if the tale were gradually approached, some of the characters introduced (as it were) beforehand, and the book started in the tone of a novel of manners and experience briefly treated, this defect might be lessened and our mystery seem to inhere in life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique of the Mystery Story does not permit it to be a novel of manners, and yet the manners must not be neglected. If a Detective Story is to be literature, what may be called its manners must be looked after quite as carefully as its plot, though by no means with such conspicuous result. Intrinsic merit must be the real basis of its interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the care and artistic conscience that count, notwithstanding the ideas expressed in &quot;The Wrecker&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Julian Hawthorne truly says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot make a riddle story by beginning it and then trusting to luck to bring it to an end. You must know all about the end and the middle before thinking, even, of the beginning; the beginning of a riddle story, unlike those of other stories and of other enterprises, is not half the battle; it is next to being quite unimportant, and, moreover, it is always easy. The unexplained corpse lies weltering in its gore in the first paragraph; the inexplicable cipher presents its enigma at the turning of the opening page. The writer who is secure in the knowledge that he has got a good thing coming, and has arranged the manner and details of its coming, cannot go far wrong with his exordium; he wants to get into action at once, and that is his best assurance that he will do it in the right way. But O! what a labor and sweat it is; what a planning and trimming; what a remodeling, curtailing, interlining; what despairs succeeded by new lights, what heroic expedients tried at the last moment, and dismissed the moment after; what wastepaper baskets full of futilities, and what gallant commencements all over again! Did the reader know, or remotely suspect, what terrific struggles the writer of a really good detective story had sustained, he would regard the final product with a new wonder and respect, and read it all over once more to find out how the troubles occurred. But he will search in vain; there are no signs of them left; no, not so much as a scar. The tale moves along as smoothly and inevitably as oiled machinery; obviously, it could not have been arranged otherwise than it is; and the wise reader is convinced that he could have done the thing himself without half trying. At that, the weary writer smiles a bitter smile; but it is one of the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes. Nobody, except him who has tried it, will ever know how hard it is to write a really good detective story. The man or woman who can do it can also write a good play (according to modern ideas of plays), and possesses force of character, individuality, and mental ability. He or she must combine the intuition of the artist with the talent of the master mechanic, but will seldom be a poet, and will generally care more for things and events than for fellow creatures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Julian Hawthorne also discusses this question of interest as maintained by the inverse order of narration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;… One charge, at least, does lie against the door of the riddle-story writer; and that is, that he is not sincere; he makes his mysteries backward, and knows the answer to his riddle before he states its terms. He deliberately supplies his reader, also, with all manner of false scents, well knowing them to be such; and concocts various seeming artless and innocent remarks and allusions, which in reality are diabolically artful, and would deceive the very elect. All this, I say, must be conceded; but it is not unfair; the very object, ostensibly, of the riddle story is to prompt you to sharpen your wits; and as you are yourself the real detective in the case, so you must regard your author as the real criminal whom you are to detect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say that Poe&#39;s conception of the interest-element in the Detective Story, as illustrated by his three great tales, &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; &quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget,11 was that the great point was not the fascination of the mystery itself but the interest the reader would take in following the successive steps of reasoning by which the crime was ferreted out. The reader is thus turned into an analytical observer who not only delights in the mental ingenuity exhibited by the detective, but actually joins with him in working out the intricacies of a problem which, though at first seemingly insoluble, is at length mastered entirely. Thus his admiration for the &quot;investigator&quot; is happily coupled with his own delight in unraveling the skein which the author has woven expressly for the purpose, as Poe himself expresses it when he admits all the merits of the device, but modestly disclaims that his ingenious stories have real greatness. He speaks thus about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They owe most of their popularity to being something in a new key. I do not mean to say that they are not ingenious—but people think them more ingenious than they are—on account of their method and air of method. In the &#39;Murders in the Rue Morgue,1 for instance, where is the ingenuity of unraveling a web which you yourself (the author) have woven for the express purpose of unraveling? The reader is made to confound the ingenuity of the supposititious Dupin with that of the writer of the story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the ingenuity of the author and that of his character are identical, as they are in the case of Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Doyle admits frankly his indebtedness to Poe, and though he claims another prototype than Dupin for his detective, yet he makes this acknowledgment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Edgar Allan Poe, who, in his carelessly prodigal fashion, threw out the seeds from which so many of our present forms of literature have sprung, was the father of the detective tale, and covered its limits so completely that I fail to see how his followers can find any fresh ground which they can confidently call their own. For the secret of the thinness and also of the intensity of the detective story is that the writer is left with only one quality, that of intellectual acuteness, with which to endow his hearer. Everything else is outside the picture and weakens the effect. The problem and its solution must form the theme, and the character drawing is limited and subordinate. On this narrow path the writer must walk, and he sees the footmarks of Poe always in front of him. He is happy if he ever finds the means of breaking away and striking out on some little side-track of his own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-summing-up&quot;&gt;A Summing Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, then, we must agree that for devotees the Detective Story sets a stirring mental exercise, with just enough of the complex background of life to distinguish it from a problem in mathematics. Whatever thrills of horror are excited come by way of the intellect, never starting directly in the emotions. The reader divests himself of sympathy, and applies to every situation the dry light of reason. It is only when one&#39;s reason is baffled, leaving the murder unexplained or the ghost at large, that one feels privileged to shudder. And such a shudder is remarkably different from a start that is unthinking. The Detective Story applies reason to some of the big half-mysteries of human conduct; and the result for the ordinary reader is not dissimilar to that felt by the philosopher when trying to square with his poor apparatus the secrets of Nature and Providence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The all-important character of the Detective Story is, of course, the Detective. He is not only the Star Performer, but the reason for the Detective Story itself. What Mr. Hawthorne calls the Transcendent Detective is the detective of fiction. Such a one is made, not born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Vance Thompson puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Readers who pant breathlessly after Sherlock Holmes and his like should give thanks to Edgar Allan Poe; when he invented Dupin in the &#39;Murders in the Rue Morgue,&#39; he created once for all the type of the detective in fiction. In all the years it has not changed very much. Sherlock Holmes still sits in his dark, superheated chamber; he is drugged with tobacco and opium; he maintains the &#39;profound silence&#39; that distinguished Poe&#39;s cold analyst; indeed, one may be sure that the type will live for another eighty years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-detective-and-his-work&quot;&gt;The Real Detective and His Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have already agreed that this fiction detective has little or nothing to do with the real detective. When M. Goron, one of the greatest of French detectives, was asked concerning this, he replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I dare say I have read nearly all the detective stories, those of Poe and Gaboriau, and &#39;Sir Doyle&#39;s&#39; clever tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like everyone else I love to follow the twists and turns that lead to the end of these apparently inexplicable problems. It is a good intellectual sport—like playing chess. But do not imagine for a moment,&quot; and M. Goron was emphatic, &quot;that it has anything at all to do with practical police work. Nothing at all. It is not by such subtle, opium-bred guesswork and fine-drawn deduction that criminals are detected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Goron&#39;s theory is that in thief-taking, as in everything else, system is of prime importance; and after that the most effective auxiliary of the detective is Chance. Almost always it is by a lucky hazard that the shrewd criminal is brought down. For instance, the taking of Magne; it was tragically absurd—for the farce ended in the basket of wet sawdust under the guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, detectives of real life invariably scorn the transcendent detective of fiction, and, in his turn, the story-book detective scoffs at the methods of the Central Office men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Arthur C. Train, in &quot;Courts Criminal and The Camorra,&quot; thus mildly satirizes our detective of fiction and sets him quite apart from the genuine article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The sanctified tradition that a detective was an agile person with a variety of side whiskers no longer obtains even in light literature, and the most imaginative of us is frankly aware of the fact that a detective is just a common man earning (or pretending to earn) a common living by common and obvious means. Yet in spite of ourselves we are accustomed to attribute superhuman acuteness and a lightning-like rapidity of intellect to this vague and romantic class of fellow-citizens. The ordinary work of a detective, however, requires neither of these qualities. Honesty and obedience are his chief requirements, and if he have intelligence as well, so much the better, provided it be of the variety known as horse sense. A genuine candidate for the job of Sherlock Holmes would find little competition. In the first place, the usual work of a detective does not demand any extraordinary powers of deduction at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There are a very large number of persons who go into the detective business for the same reason that others enter the ministry—they can&#39;t make a living at anything else. Provided he has squint eyes and a dark complexion, almost anybody feels that he is qualified to unravel the tangled threads of crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The real detective is the one who, taking up the solution of a crime or other mystery, brings to bear upon it unusual powers of observation and deduction and an exceptional resourcefulness in acting upon his conclusions. Frankly, I have known very few such, although for some ten years I have made use of a large number of so-called detectives in both public and private matters. As I recall the long line of cases were these men have rendered service of great value, almost every one resolves itself into a successful piece of mere spying or trailing. Little ingenuity or powers of reason were required. Of course, there are a thousand tricks that an experienced man acquires as a matter of course, but which at first sight seem almost like inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no more reason to look for superiority of intelligence or mental alertness among detectives of the ordinary class than there is to expect it from clerks, stationary engineers, plumbers, or firemen. While comparisons are invidious, I should be inclined to say that the ordinary chauffeur was probably a brighter man than the average detective. This is not to be taken in derogation of the latter, but as a compliment to the former. There is more reason why he should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The telephone is the modern detective&#39;s chief ally, and he relies upon rapidity more than upon deduction. Under present conditions it is easier to overtake a crook than to reason out what he will probably do. In fact, the old-fashioned &#39;deductive detective1 is largely a man of the past. The most useless operator in the world is the one who is &#39;wedded to his own theory&#39; of the case—the man who asks no questions and relies only on himself. Interject a new element into a case and such a man is all at sea. In the meantime the criminal has made his &#39;get away.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In the story-books your detective scans with eagle eye the surface of the floor for microscopic evidences of crime. His mind leaps from a cigar ash to a piece of banana peel and thence to what the family had for dinner. His brain is working all the time. His gray matter dwarfs almost to insignificance that of Daniel Webster or the Hon. Benjamin F. Butler. It is, of course, all quite wonderful and most excellent reading, and the old-style sleuth really thought he could do it! Nowadays, while the fake detective is snooping around the back piazza with a telescope, the real one is getting the &#39;dope&#39; from the village blacksmith or barber (if there is any except on Saturday nights) or the girl that slings the pie at the station. These folk have something to go on. They may not be highly intelligent, but they know the country, and, what is more important, they know the people. All the brains in the world cannot make up for the lack of an elementary knowledge of the place and the characters themselves. It stands to reason that no strange detective could form as good an opinion as to which of the members of your household would be most likely to steal a piece of jewelry as you could yourself. Yet the old-fashioned Sherlock knew and knows it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no mystery about such work, except what the detective himself sees fit to enshroud it with. Most of us do detective work all the time without being conscious of it. Simply because the matter concerns the theft of a pearl, or the betraying of a business or professional secret, or the disappearance of a friend, the opinion of a stranger becomes no more valuable. And the chances are equal that the stranger will make a bungle of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The national detective agency with its thousands of employees who have, most of them, grown up and received their training in its service, is a powerful organization, highly centralized, and having an immense sinking fund of special knowledge and past experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the product of decades of patient labor and minute record. The agency which offers you the services of a Sherlock Holmes is a fraud, but you can accept as genuine a proposition to run down any man whose picture you may be able to identify in the gallery. The day of the impersonator is over. The detective of this generation is a hard-headed business man with a stout pair of legs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the reader will observe that there are just a few more real detectives still left in the business—if you can find them. Incidentally, they one and all take off their hats to Scotland Yard. They will tell you that the Englishman may be slow (fancy an American Inspector of Police wearing gray suede gloves and brewing himself a dish of tea in his office at four o&#39;clock!), but that once he goes after a crook he is bound to get him—it is merely a question of time. I may add that in the opinion of the heads of the big agencies the percentage of ability in the New York Detective Bureau is high—one of them going so far as to claim that fifty percent of the men have real detective ability—that is to say &quot;brains.&quot; That is rather a higher average than one finds among clergymen and lawyers, yet it may be so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. John Wilson Murray, one of the noted detectives, says simply in his &quot;Memoirs of a Great Detective&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no magic about the detective business. A detective walking along the street does not suddenly hear a mysterious voice whisper &#39;Banker John Jones has just been robbed of $1,000,000.&#39; He does not turn the corner and come upon a perfect stranger, and then, because the stranger has a twisted cigar in his mouth, suddenly pounce upon him and exclaim: &#39;Aha, villain that you are! give back to Banker Jones the $1,000,000 you stole ten minutes ago!1 The detective business is of no such foolish and impossible character. Detectives are not clairvoyants, or infallible prophets, or supernatural seers. They possess no uncanny powers and no mantle of mysterious wonder-working. I remember a few years ago I was subpoenaed before a grand jury in the City of New York to testify on a matter pertaining to a prisoner, whose record I knew here in Canada. The foreman of that jury was a man prominent in New York&#39;s business life. When I was called he looked at me and suddenly said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#39;Inspector Murray, what crimes have been committed within the past hour in New York, and who committed them?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#39;I have not the slightest idea,&#39; I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#39;Oh, ho! So you cannot go out and put your hands on every man who has committed a crime? You are a detective, yet cannot do that?&#39; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#39;I am not that kind of detective,&#39; I replied. &#39;When I get a guilty man it usually is by hard work or good luck, and often by both.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#39;Thank the Lord we&#39;ve found a detective who is not greater than God,&#39; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As a matter of fact the detective business is a plain ordinary business, just like a lawyer&#39;s business, a doctor&#39;s business, a railway manager&#39;s business. It has its own peculiarities because it deals with crime, with the distorted, imperfect, diseased members of the social body, just as a surgeon&#39;s business deals with the distorted, imperfect, diseased members of the physical body. But it is not an abnormal or phenomenal or incomprehensible business. There is nothing done in it, nothing accomplished by any detective, that is not the result of conscientious work, the exercise of human intelligence, an efficient system of organization and intercommunication, and good luck. A good detective must be quick to think, keen to analyse, persistent, resourceful, courageous. But the best detective in the world is a human being, neither half-devil nor half-god, but just a man with the attributes or associates that make him successful in his occupation. &quot;The best detective, therefore, is a man who instinctively detects the truth, lost though it may be in a maze of lies. By instinct he is a detective. He is born to it; his business is his natural bent. It would be a platitude to say the best detectives are born, not made. They are both born and made for the business. The man who, by temperament and make-up, is an ideal detective, must go through the hard years of steady work, must apply himself, and study and toil in making himself what he is born to he. Sandow was born to be a strong man, but, if he had not developed himself by hard work, he would not have become the strongest man of his time. As a detective advances in his business he will find that the more he studies and works, the stronger his powers of intuition, of divination, of analysis become. A very simple broad illustration will prove this. If a detective is chasing a criminal from country to country, and has learned, by study of the extradition treaties, that a certain country offers a better haven than another, he may save himself many a weary mile by going to the country where his common sense tells him his man is more likely to be. A mechanical knowledge of the use of tools, a knowledge of the effects of poisons, a knowledge of the ways of banking, of the habits of life of the various classes, in various callings, a knowledge of crooks, and, above all, a knowledge of human nature, in whatsoever way manifest, are invaluable elements of the equipment of a good detective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fictive-detective-material&quot;&gt;Fictive Detective Material&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual work, then, of a real detective does not demand the extraordinary powers of the fiction detective. But the plots selected by fiction writers for their stories are the cases that do demand it. And this, because it interests the reader&#39;s imagination, piques his curiosity and makes possible the solution of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assertion of Sherlock Holmes founded on the aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction is in itself fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man can invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction, with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions, most stale and unprofitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And yet I am not convinced of it,&quot; I answered. &quot;The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,&quot; remarked Holmes. &quot;This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first-quoted remarks of Holmes are pure fiction and are introduced by the author to give an effect which he desires. But it is the truth that a certain selection and discretion must be used regarding plots, and it is this that makes or mars the interest of the Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe&#39;s three masterpieces of detective fiction are perfectly conceived, constructed and completed, entirely in his imagination. But when he undertook &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; he worked upon a plot founded on fact; the story of a real murder of a real girl, with the result that there was no denouement, and the editors of the magazine in which the story originally appeared, decided that it would be best to omit the latter half of the tale, and we are told that it was never printed in full. Though interesting in its statement of the problem, the solution never could be reached, and the story, as a Detective Story, was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-transcendent-detective&quot;&gt;The Transcendent Detective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status of the fiction detective is so well-defined that it is the habit of authors to scoff at it, and endeavor to convince us that their own detectives are true to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in a Detective Story of some merit, called &quot;The House Opposite,&quot; by Elizabeth Kent, the detective says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am aware that the detective of fiction is always supposed to be omniscient, but my profession. Doctor, is just like any other. There is no hocus-pocus about it. To succeed in it requires, in the first place, accurate and most minute powers of observation, unlimited patience, the capacity of putting two and two together. Add to this an unprejudiced mind, and last, but not least, respect, amounting to reverence, for any established fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many authors of late think it argues themselves original to indulge in a fleer at the methods of Sherlock Holmes. A typical example of this often-used device is here quoted from &quot;Midnight at Mears House,&quot; by Harrison J. Holt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I smoked, my gaze travelled idly about the room till it rested upon the big brass candlestick smeared with melted tallow which we had found that morning on the dining table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I were only another Sherlock Holmes now,&quot; I thought,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I should be able to reconstruct the entire tragedy from that candlestick, supposing of course the murderer used it. An intelligent smell of the wick would tell me what particular brand of matches he used to light it, and it would only be necessary to visit the one dealer who kept them and get from him a photograph of the man, or a sufficiently accurate description of him, to make his arrest a matter of only a trifling difficulty.&quot; I chuckled at the absurdity of the notion. It seemed however, hardly more far-fetched and ridiculous than some of the great detective&#39;s marvellous exploits, which millions of readers have found plausible enough, I daresay, though I was never one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yielding to a sudden whim, I took down the candlestick from the mantelpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I should at least be able to deduce a few simple facts from a really scientific examination of it,11 I argued, facetiously—&quot;whether the criminal was right or left- handed, for instance, or wore ready-made clothes, or if he was suffering from rheumatism or the whooping cough. It must be all here somewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I proceeded gravely to smell of the wick. It had a decidedly burnt odour, due very likely, I imagined, to its having been lighted. It humiliated me, however, to be unable to decide how it had been lighted. I could not for the life of me make out whether the murderer had used wax vesta, safety-matches, ordinary parlour matches, or those infernal things tipped with sulphur commonly known as &quot;hell-sticks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He might even have lighted it with one of those self- igniting platinum-wire and alcohol devices, or with flint and steel, or by rubbing two sticks together, for all I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I began to feel discouraged. Doubtless there were imprints of his fingers as thick as flies and as plain as billboards all over the candlestick itself, if I could only find them. He would at any rate have left the damning mark of his thumb somewhere upon its shining surface: they were always considerate enough to do that—in the detective stories. It was part of the game. But again I was doomed to disappointment. We must have blurred the impressions through our inconceivable stupidity in touching the thing at all. We should have known enough,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I reflected, to have left it alone till we had a chance to study it through a high-powered telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good-natured satire, and the very fact that it contains the kernel of truth makes it effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pioneer-detectives-of-fiction&quot;&gt;Pioneer Detectives of Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though lacking the title, the Transcendent Detective doubtless makes his earliest appearance in the person of M. Dupin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first allusion to Dupin&#39;s peculiar talents is found in &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise—if not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manners at these moments were frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the creative and the resolvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased, intelligence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe deliberately remarks on Dupin&#39;s diseased intelligence, thus providing a defence against any implication that the detective&#39;s powers were superhuman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogous to this is Conan Doyle&#39;s characterization of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; where Holmes makes his first appearance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I&#39;m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger-ends, it is odd if you can&#39;t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And these other people?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They are mostly sent out by private inquiry agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But do you mean to say,&quot; I said, &quot;that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see, I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the later detective thus scorns the earlier one when Watson, thinking to flatter, compares Holmes to Dupin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,&quot; he observed. &quot;Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends&#39; thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour&#39;s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you read Gaboriau&#39;s works?&quot; I asked. &quot;Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Lecoq was a miserable bungler/1 he said, in an angry voice; &quot;he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dupin himself speaks with equal contempt of his predecessor in the profession. He says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man. But without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Conan Doyle himself declares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In a work which consists in the drawing of detectives,&quot; he once wrote, &quot;there are only one or two qualities which one can use, and an author is forced to hark back upon them constantly, so that every detective must really resemble every other detective to a greater or less extent. There is no great originality required in devising or constructing such a man, and the only possible originality which one can get into a story about a detective is in giving him original plots and problems to solve, as in his equipment there must be an alert acuteness of mind to grasp facts and the relation which each of them bears to the other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detectives who follow in the straight path trodden by these pioneers are legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the best known is The Thinking Machine, hero of two series of stories by the late Jacques Futrelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thinking Machine whose name was Professor Van Dusen was remotely German. For generations his ancestors had been noted in the sciences; he was the logical result of the master mind. First and above all he was a logician. At least thirty-five years of the half-century or so of his existence had been devoted exclusively to proving that two and two always equal four, except in unusual cases, where they equal three or five, as the case may be. He stood broadly on the general proposition that all things that start must go somewhere, and was able to bring the concentrated mental force of his forefathers to bear on a given problem. Incidentally it may be remarked that Professor Van Dusen wore a No. 8 hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recent-detectives-of-fiction&quot;&gt;Recent Detectives of Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the best of lately-written detective stories are two by Gaston Leroux, &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; and &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black.&quot; In these stories two detectives figure. Though they are professional and amateur, they are not opposed, as is so often deemed necessary for dramatic effect, but have a far subtler contrast. Rouletabille is a delightful character and satisfactory in his procedure, while Larsan is a genius. And yet these detectives are little known to the reading public. It is perhaps because Sherlock Holmes was first in the modern field, and perhaps partly because his name appears in the titles of the collections of stories about him, that his name is so well known. Mr. Cecil Chesterton is right in saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is at least entitled to claim the honour of being the only novelist since Dickens, one of whose creations has become a popular proverb. It is easy to test this. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is generally considered a popular writer. Mulvaney is probably Mr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kipling&#39;s most popular creation. But let anyone say in an assembly of twenty average men chosen at random from the street—&#39;That man is quite a Mulvaney.&#39; Perhaps two men will understand the reference; perhaps one; quite possibly none. But let him say &#39;That man is quite a Sherlock Holmes.1 The recognition will be instantaneous and unanimous. A man who had not heard of Holmes would be more singular than a man who could not sign his own name. Sir Arthur is the only writer of our time who has done this, and he has never done it twice. He has done more ambitious work than the Sherlock Holmes tales, but none of it has passed into the language.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many series of really good detective stories have been published in magazines, and later in book form, but not one reader in ten remembers the detective&#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luther Trant and Craig Kennedy, Ledroit Conners and Eugene Valmont, are all first class fiction detectives yet their names are not household words like Sherlock Holmes. So with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Man in the Corner, Average Jones, Ashton-Kirk and Paul Beck. So with Scientific Sprague and Astro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though each of these is a real deductive detective, each has his own personal bent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprague, Trant and Kennedy are scientific,—sometimes so much so that they run great danger of losing the popular interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Sprague&#39;s manner as the author, Francis Lynde, shows us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When my attention was first called to such things—it was on a case in the Department of Justice in which I was required to give expert testimony—I was very strongly impressed with the crudities of the ordinary detective methods. I said to myself that what was needed was some one who could apply good, careful laboratory practice; a habit of observation which counts nothing too small to be weighed and measured.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Go on,&quot; said Maxwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The idea came to me that I&#39;d like to try it on, and I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My theory is correct. Human beings react under certain given conditions just as readily, and just as inevitably, as the inorganic substances react in a laboratory experiment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not sure that I can explain it so that you will understand, but I&#39;ll try. In the first place, it is necessary to go at these little problems with a perfectly open mind—the laboratory mind, which is neither prejudiced nor prepossessed nor in any way concerned with anything but the bare facts. Reason, and the proper emphasis to be placed upon each fact as it comes to bat, are the two needful qualities in any problem solving—and about the only two.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can no more tell you, Dick, than I can explain why, to a majority of people, white is white and black is black. For my own satisfaction I define the &#39;how&#39; as a natural growth, favored by habit and training, of the scientific attitude; the mental slant which, if given free play, almost unconsciously notes, marks, deduces, reasons; deeming nothing too small or too trifling to go toward making up the whole of any conclusion. More than that, in my own case the faculty is able to hold itself workably aloof from the ordinary distractions of conversation and the like. It goes on, using the outward senses when it needs them, to be sure, but only as aids to the developing of its own little film in its own little dark room. Do you get the idea?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-scientific-detective-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Scientific Detective of Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all legitimate, but tinged rather deeply with science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig Kennedy (created by Arthur B. Reeve) says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It has always seemed strange to me that no one has ever endowed a professorship in criminal science in any of our large universities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Craig Kennedy laid down his evening paper and filled his pipe with my tobacco. In college we had roomed together, had shared everything, even poverty, and now that Craig was a professor of chemistry and I was on the staff of the Star, we had continued the arrangement. Prosperity found us in a rather neat bachelor apartment on the Heights, not far from the University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why should there be a chair in criminal science?&quot; I remarked argumentatively, settling back in my chair. &quot;I&#39;ve done my turn at police headquarters reporting, and I can tell you, Craig, it&#39;s no place for a college professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Crime is just crime. And as for dealing with it, the good detective is born and bred to it. College professors for the sociology of the thing, yes; for the detection of it give me a Byrnes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On the contrary,&quot; replied Kennedy, his cleancut features betraying an earnestness which I knew indicated that he was leading up to something important, &quot;there is a distinct place for science in the detection of crime. &quot;Colleges have gone a long way from the old ideal of pure culture. They have got down to solving the hard facts of life—pretty nearly an except one. They still treat crime in the old way, study its statistics and pore over its causes and the theories of how it can be prevented. But as for running the criminal himself down, scientifically, relentlessly—bah! we haven&#39;t made an inch of progress since the hammer and tongs method of your Byrnes.&quot; &quot;Doubtless you will write a thesis on this most interesting subject,&quot; I suggested, &quot;and let it go at that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, I am serious,&quot; he replied, determined for some reason or other to make a convert of me. &quot;I mean exactly what I say. I am going to apply science to the detection of crime, the same sort of methods by which you trace out the presence of a chemical, or run an unknown germ to earth. And before I have gone far, I am going to enlist Walter Jameson as an aide. I think I shall need you in my business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How do I come in?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, for one thing, you will get a scoop, a beat,—whatever you call it in that newspaper jargon of yours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy&#39;s methods and descriptions, though interesting to scientific minds, are often above the heads of a popular audience. For instance such a paragraph as this,—and in his stories they abound:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This twelfth series is interesting. So far only radium, thorium, and uranium are generally known. We know that the radio-active elements are constantly breaking down, and one often hears uranium, for instance, called the &#39;parent&#39; of radium. Radium also gives off an emanation, and among its products is helium, quite another element. Thus the transmutation of matter is, within certain bounds, well known to-day to all scientists like yourself, Professor Kennedy. It has even been rumored but never proved that copper has been transformed into lithium—both members of the hydrogen-gold group, you will observe. Copper to lithium is going backward, so to speak. It has remained for me to devise this protodyne apparatus by which I can reverse that process of decay and go forward in the table,—can change lithium into copper and copper into gold. I can create and destroy matter by protodyne.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-psychology-in-detective-stories&quot;&gt;The New Psychology in Detective Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stories of Craig Kennedy published under the title of &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; are based upon the various chapters of Professor Hugo Miinsterberg&#39;s delightful book called &quot;On The Witness Stand.&quot; It is hoped and believed by Professor Miinster- berg that these psychological experiments will yet become a practical means of the conviction of criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have not as yet obtained official sanction, but as Professor Miinsterberg writes in a personal letter,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I myself did not expect such changes to come very soon, as on the one side there is still too much difference of opinion and of interpretation among the psychologists, and on the other side the whole problem of the experts before court is still in too confused a condition. An amateurish introduction of fancy experiments by lawyers who are dilettantists in psychology would certainly bring more confusion than help. All that has been gained is that evidently the lawyers and judges have become more conscious of the responsibilities which are involved wherever psychical functions are in play. I also think that the use of the brutal methods of extorting confessions and so on has been diminished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of stories called &quot;The Achievements of Luther Trant,&quot; by Edwin Balmer and William MacHarg, details the experiments of a detective who follows even more closely the experiments described in Professor Miinsterberg&#39;s book. The Foreword of this series tells its own story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Except for its characters and plot, this book is not a work of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The methods which the fictitious Trant—one-time assistant in a psychological laboratory, now turned detective—here uses to solve the mysteries which present themselves to him, are real methods; the tests he employs are real tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Though little known to the general public, they are precisely such as are being used daily in the psychological laboratories of the great universities—both in America and Europe—by means of which modern men of science are at last disclosing and defining the workings of that oldest of world mysteries—the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The facts which Trant uses are in no way debatable facts; nor do they rest on evidence of untrained, imaginative observers. Innumerable experiments in our university laboratories have established beyond question that, for instance, the resistance of the human body to a weak electric current varies when the subject is frightened or undergoes emotion; and the consequent variation in the strength of the current depending directly upon the amount of emotional disturbance, can be registered by the galvanometer for all to see. The hand resting upon an automatograph will travel toward an object which excites emotion, however capable its possessor may be of restraining all other evidence of what he feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If these facts are not used as yet except in the academic experiments of the psychological laboratories and the very real and useful purpose to which they have been put in the diagnosis of insanities, it is not because they are incapable of wider use. The results of the &#39;new psychology1 are coming every day closer to an exact interpretation. The hour is close at hand when they will be used not merely in the determination of guilt and innocence, but to establish in the courts the credibility of witnesses and the impartiality of jurors, and by employers to ascertain the fitness and particular abilities of their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Luther Trant, therefore, nowhere in this book needs to invent or devise an experiment or an instrument for any of the results he here attains; he has merely to adopt a part of the tried and accepted experiments of modern, scientific psychology. He himself is a character of fiction; but his methods are matters of fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar method is hinted at in &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; stories. Mr. Futrelle says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Finally, with my hand on her pulse—which was normal—I told her as brutally as I could that her husband had been murdered. Her pulse jumped frightfully and as I told her the cause of death it wavered, weakened and she fainted. Now if she had known her husband were dead—even if she had killed him—a mere statement of his death would not have caused that pulse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-types&quot;&gt;Other Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Man In The Corner,&quot; by Baroness Orczy, introduces himself in this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The man in the corner pushed aside his glass, and leant across the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Mysteries!&quot; he commented. &quot;There is no such thing as a mystery in connection with any crime, provided intelligence is brought to bear upon its investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparatively novel type of detective is Astro. This individual figures in a series of stories published in book form under title of &quot;The Master of Mysteries.&quot; These stories are by Mr. Gelett Burgess, but are published anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective is a poseur, of a languid and self-conscious personality, who pretends to be a palmist and crystal-gazer, but who really is simply a clever sleuth detective. At his seances, conducted in draped and darkened apartments, he wears Oriental costume and is exceedingly bored. Instead of a Doctor Watson, he has for assistant a beautiful young woman named Valeska. The romance of these two runs through the book, and culminates on the last page with a &quot;clergyman and witnesses.&quot; But the stories are properly constructed detective fiction of good technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;firstpara&quot;&gt;Pick up any mystery novel and you&#39;re presented with a mystery beyond the one on the pages of the book or short story you&#39;ve selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mystery is what kind of mystery story are you holding? From amateur detectives to whounits, a vast expanse of styles, types, subgenres and schools of mystery, crime, and detective stories abound. For any fan, whatever flavor of mystery they most enjoy, it is a vital skill to be able to discern the minute differences between Cozy and Golden Age, or the classic whodunit vs. the howdunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a selection of the most prominent subgenres, schools, and types of mystery fiction. While it may be simplest to find the larger categories in which to drop a story, most great mystery fiction takes elements from more than one category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you find the clues in your story to accurately determine in which category or categories it belongs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amateur-detective&quot;&gt;Amateur Detective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amateur detective mystery is one in which the main character pursuing the mystery is not a professional detective but is instead an everyday person, perhaps a housewife or casual friend of the victim or suspect who takes it upon himself or herself solve the mystery. The detective may be pursuing the case as part of a profession, like a reporter, doctor or lawyer. However, the key aspect of amateur detective fiction is that the sleuth does not formally work as any kind of private or police detective. The detecting is subsequent to his primary role or career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include Father Brown, a Catholic priest and hero of 51 detective short stories by G. K. Chesterton; Nancy Drew, a high school girl created by Edward Statemeyer; Miss Marple, of Agatha Christie&#39;s novels; and Lord Peter Wimsey, a wealthy English gentleman, created by Dorothy L. Sayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called an &lt;em&gt;am sleuth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;am detective&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ancientprehistoric-aka-pre-poe&quot;&gt;Ancient/prehistoric (aka, pre-Poe)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Edgar Allen Poe is generally credited with creating the modern mystery story and the modern detective, his &lt;em&gt;Murders on the Rue Morgue&lt;/em&gt; (1841) are not the first mystery stories written. As far back as Ancient Greece and Rome, audiences have been fascinated by murder and the pursuit of justice for the victim. Sophocles, among other Greek dramatists, spun yarns of murder, including his play &lt;em&gt;Oedipus the King&lt;/em&gt; (first performed around 429 B.C.E).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Renaissance Period in Europe, as the general public learned to read, sensationalized reports of villains&#39; capture, trials, imprisonment and execution titillated the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other stories, like &quot;The Three Apples&quot; from &lt;em&gt;One Thousand and One Arabian Nights&lt;/em&gt; (800-1300), Thomas De Quincy&#39;s &quot;On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts&quot; published in &lt;em&gt;Blackwood&#39;s Magazine&lt;/em&gt; in 1827, and E. T. A. Hoffman&#39;s novella &lt;em&gt;Das Fräulein von Scuderi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;Erzählung aus dem Zeitalter Ludwig des Vierzehnten&lt;/em&gt; (1819) are prime examples of the pre-Poe mystery stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caper&quot;&gt;Caper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caper story is a humorous, adventurous or otherwise clever example of the classic straight crime story. It involves crooks who, through unusual demonstration of creativity, embark on a mission to steal valuable jewels, painting, or other artifact from a highly secured museum or bank vault. The crooks, themselves, are the heroes of the genre, often portrayed as Robin Hood-esque characters fighting against corrupt government or business entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caper is a highly suspenseful story in which the daring crook is pitted against police or merely the security measures in place to prevent the theft. The story may focus only on the planning and execution of the theft, or it may open with the audacious actions of the balaclava-masked intruder lowering himself from the museum ceiling to outwit the security, then follow as the crook must evade capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular examples from novels include Donald E. Westlake&#39;s highly comic tales of unusual thefts to Lawrence Block&#39;s Bernie Rhodenbarr novels of an honest crook up against a corrupt cop. Ever a popular genre for films, the caper crime story is featured in the &lt;em&gt;Ocean&#39;s Eleven&lt;/em&gt; (2001) film and sequels (2004, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can also be called a &lt;em&gt;heist&lt;/em&gt;, but that often entails a more serious treatment, rather than the emphasis on the daring-do and dauntless creativity of the caper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;childwoman-in-peril&quot;&gt;Child/Woman in Peril&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the focus is either a child or woman who is put in harm&#39;s way because of a crime commit either by someone they know like a parent, or because of something they, themselves did. The story focuses on their struggle to free themselves from the forces of evil pitted against them. Often told through the personal voice of the victim, the child or woman in peril mystery can be one of the most jarring styles of mystery writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written in 1748, the novel &lt;em&gt;Clarissa, or the History of a Young Lady&lt;/em&gt; by Samuel Richardson is one of the earliest examples but the form became popular in the post-war men&#39;s adventure pulp magazines, which often told of women kidnapped by Nazi or Japanese soldiers and forced to spy or do other horrendous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child in peril group of mystery stories stems from fairy tales like those of the Brothers Grimm. Modern examples include the &lt;em&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/em&gt; stories (beginning in 1908) by Lucy Maud Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;womand/child in&lt;/em&gt; jeopardy, damsel &lt;em&gt;in distress&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;kidnapping&lt;/em&gt; mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comicbumbling-detective&quot;&gt;Comic/Bumbling Detective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&#39;re looking for a laugh or just a giggle, the comic or bumbling detective story provides a lighter approach to the mystery. Here, the emphasis is on a detective who, despite his clumsy or inept ways, manages to solve the crime at hand. The classic example that most people will think of is Blake Edward&#39;s creation of Inspector Clouseau, of the French Surete, and played in the films by Peter Sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the subgenre of mysteries that require readers to suspend the most disbelief, bumbling detective stories focus on the absurd, both in overall plot and in the usually circuitous route taken to nab the perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Clouseau, other comic detectives include the journalist-pair of X, featured in Y&#39;s short stories like &quot;Z&quot;, featured in A magazine. Others include the Columbo stories starring Peter Falk on television, and &lt;em&gt;The Burglar Who Like to Quote Kipling&lt;/em&gt; (1979) by Lawrence Block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;humorous&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt; mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cozy&quot;&gt;Cozy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First appearing in the later part of the twentieth century, the cozy mystery is an homage to the Golden Age British novels of the 1920s and 1930s. Distinct from the Golden Age not just in time period, cozies are narrower in definition than their predecessors. They are distinct in their adherence to keeping violence and sex off the page. Ripe with murder of all ilks, cozy mysteries put an emphasis on the elaborate murder weapons and the aftermath of the killing rather than on demonstrating it. Even when the killer is unmasked, he or she gives up without a fight and frequently gives a soliloquy explanation of why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sleuths of the cozy mystery are typically women, typically amateur. Rather than being some kind of detective, the detectives are everyday folk like teachers, chefs, librarians, and little old ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major authors of cozy mystery novels include Lilian Jackson Braun, known for her &lt;em&gt;The Cat Who …&lt;/em&gt; series; Rita Mae Brown (&lt;em&gt;The Foxhunting Mystery Series&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mags &amp;amp; Baxter Mystery Series&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Mrs. Murphy&lt;/em&gt; series that was &quot;co-authored with her talking cat as the main character.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cozy mysteries may also be called &lt;em&gt;cozies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;softboiled&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;little old lady mysteries&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;espionage&quot;&gt;Espionage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ever-popular subgenre of crime fiction, the espionage mystery is set on the stage of international politics and international intrigue. Rather than private or police detectives, heroes are spies, counter-spies and other intelligence officers. It is thematically similar to adventure fiction, political thrillers and military thrillers but includes the elements of mystery such as a murdered spy or lost piece of intelligence that the hero must find before the minions of the evil empire can take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G. K. Chesterton gives us an excellent example of the espionage mystery in his 1908 &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Was Thursday&lt;/em&gt;, which tells of the infiltration of an anarchist organization by detectives. Sherlock Holmes also served as a spyhunter in &quot;The Adventures of the Second Stain&quot; (1904).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;spy novel&quot; was coined by Irish author Robert Erskine Childers in his 1903 novel &lt;em&gt;The Riddle of the Sands&lt;/em&gt;, in which amateur spies discover a German plan to invade Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s 1935 film &lt;em&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/em&gt; is another example of the espionage mystery story in which Richard Hannay, a London civilian, is caught up in a crime story of spies attempting to steal British military secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;spy fiction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;spy thriller&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;espionage thriller&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;spy-fi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;furry-detectives&quot;&gt;Furry Detectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furry detectives are animals, usually cats although other animals are featured, as the detectives. They may be partners of a private detective and act as more than just pets. One might think of these furry detectives like the witch&#39;s familiar providing magical help to the befuddled human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the animal is communicative with other animals but not with their human counterparts. Often typed as a cozy or softboiled mystery, the furry detective yarn (sorry, cat/yarn…couldn&#39;t resist) eschews violence and focuses on the animal&#39;s ability to spot clues that the (usually dumber) human counterpart cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include Lilian Jackson Braun&#39;s &quot;Cat Who&quot; series that features a newspaperman and his psychic cat who gives him clues to help solve the mysteries. Fictional private detective Elvis Cole, created by Robert Crais, is a cat owner whose adopted feline is a key character in the stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could be referred to as &lt;em&gt;animal mysteries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; (or any other animal) mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;golden-age&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age of mystery fiction refers not to a specific style of story but to a period of history, typically bracketed between 1920 and the early years of World War II, with some examples dating to 1911. It primarily refers to the British school of authors who created puzzle and whodunit style stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The era produced the first codified rules for writing detective fiction, including &lt;em&gt;The Decalogue, or Ten Rules of Detective Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, created by Monsignor Ronald Knox in 1929. It, and other rule sets, emphasized the game aspect of the mystery and instituted the concept of &#39;fair play&#39;, which required the author to provide the reader with every clue that the detective saw in order to give the reader an equal chance to solve the crime before the last-page reveal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden Age stories are often set on secluded English estates, during heavy storms and at night. Locked room or impossible crime stories were part and parcel of the era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant authors and their works include: Agatha Christie, creator of Hecule Poriot, Miss Marple and other famed literary sleuths (&lt;em&gt;Peril at End House&lt;/em&gt;, …), John Dickson Carr (&lt;em&gt;The Problem of the Wire Cage&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hag&#39;s Nook&lt;/em&gt;), G. K. Chesterton (&lt;em&gt;The Innocence of Father Brown&lt;/em&gt;, ), and Dorothy L. Sayers (&lt;em&gt;Gaudy Night&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Nine Tailors&lt;/em&gt; both featuring Lord Peter Wimsey).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;locked room&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;impossible crime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paradox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt;, or (incorrectly) &lt;em&gt;cozy mysteries&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardboiled&quot;&gt;Hardboiled&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born of the Prohibition Era (1920 – 1933) in America, the hardboiled detective genre tackled the gritty side of life. A uniquely American style, although copied throughout the world, the hardboiled detective story is typified by the hard-drinking, hard-womanizing, violent, but ultimately positive anti-hero. It takes on an earthy realism with graphic violence and sex playout on against a backdrop of seedy bars, big cities, underworld influences and dangerous dames. It carries with it a sense of disillusionment, heightened by political, social and economic problems of the 1920s Prohibition and 1930s Depression eras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raymond Chandler, author of the hardboiled classic &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/em&gt; (1939), wrote that the &#39;smell of fear&#39; permiated these stories and reflected the modern condition the hardboiled authors saw and put in the embittered detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other prime examples of hardboiled fiction include James M. Cain&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Postman Always Rings Twice&lt;/em&gt; (1934) and Mickey Spillane&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I, the Jury&lt;/em&gt; (1947).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;hardboiled PI&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;private eye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;private dick&lt;/em&gt; fiction and often confused with &lt;em&gt;noir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heist&quot;&gt;Heist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the caper story, a heist mystery focuses on the crooks and their theft of some valuable property. However, in contrast to the capers humor and emphasis on the creativity of the crime, the heist is a grittier form of the straight crime story. The heist often involves heavy violence, like bank robbers with large caliber weapons. The heist is less elaborately planned than a caper and usually involves brute force to steal the item rather than light-fingered lifting of valuables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heist crime story involves the entire crime, from the planning stages through execution and escape. Stories may emphasize one aspect of the crime over the others. Rather than loveable rogue characters, heist stories attempt to capture the rawness of the career thief and show the rough and dangerous life led by men of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include the Parker series by Donald E. Westlake (writing under the pseudonym Richard Stark), including &lt;em&gt;The Hunter&lt;/em&gt; (1981) and &lt;em&gt;The Man with the Getaway Face&lt;/em&gt; (1984).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be called &lt;em&gt;straight crime stories&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;capers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;historicalperiod&quot;&gt;Historical/Period&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical mystery fiction stands out in its choice of setting, any time period prior to the modern age. The emphasis is not on any one particular style of mystery (locked room, private detective) but may include any other the other types of mystery stories. The key is the historical setting. They are, specifically, historical from the author&#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also include stories of modern detectives solving historic crimes, such as Josephine Tey&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Daughter of Time&lt;/em&gt; (1951) in which a modern policeman investigates the fifteenth century case of Richard III of England during an extended hospital stay. Other variations include alternate history or fantasy world mystery stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other prime examples include Ellis Peters &lt;em&gt;Cadfael Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; (1977 – 1994) set in the twelth century England, as well as Umbro Eco&#39;s masterpiece &lt;em&gt;In the Name of the Rose&lt;/em&gt; (1980).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called an &lt;em&gt;historical whodunit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;holmesian&quot;&gt;Holmesian&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Holmesian detective story can mean one of two things: either a story written about Sherlock Holmes by authors other than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as with &quot;The Late Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Doyle&#39;s friend and creator of Peter Pan J. M. Berry in 1893; or the moniker of a Holmesian detective story can awarded when a story closely follows the hallmarks of a Sherlock Holmes type story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berrie&#39;s pastiche is the first known of Doyle&#39;s creation but authors have created a significant body of work, expanding on the stories by the creator. Writers from Anthony Burgess, Stephen King, A. A. Milne and Neil Gaiman have all written Holmesian pastiches. Sherlock Holmes holds the record for the most television shows and film characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works similar to Doyle&#39;s work follow the conventions such as a strong-minded, deductive-type detective who uses a combination of reasoning and scientific analysis to uncover and make sense of clues. The broader Holmesian style is closely allied with the scientific school of detective fiction. Examples include P. G. Wodehouse&#39;s &quot;Death at the Excelsior&quot; (1914) and Samuel Hopkins Adams&#39; &lt;em&gt;The Flying Death&lt;/em&gt; (1903).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;scientific detective fiction&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;intuitionism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;horror&quot;&gt;Horror&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that go bump in the night. Dark moors and creatures we&#39;d rather not encounter even in the daylight. Such are the makings of the horror subgenre within mystery fiction. It has its roots in the Gothic fiction and horror novels like many works of Poe and Mary Shelly&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; (1818), with their ghosts, goblins, vampires and werewolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent times, horror mysteries have evolved to include monsters of a more human sort, the men and women who lurk in the darkness of human depravity to prey upon all sorts of humanity. These monsters, because they are mere humans, are perhaps more terrifying than the mystical monsters like ghosts and vampires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2008 novel &lt;em&gt;The Wolfman&lt;/em&gt; by Nicholas Pekearo is a fine example of the horror mystery, tackling the traditional gothic werewolf monster. Stephen King&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Bag of Bones&lt;/em&gt; (1998) is an example deftly weaves elements of the more human horror and classic private eye fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;supernatural&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gothic&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;gothic horror&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;howdunit&quot;&gt;Howdunit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fun variation of the classic whounit mystery story type is the howdunit. Here, rather than try to figure out who committed the crime, the detective must figure out how the crime was committed. The murder, or less often theft, is committed early and in full view of the reader. There is usually no doubt as to the killer&#39;s identity (although some mystery television shows, like &lt;em&gt;Columbo&lt;/em&gt; (1968 – 78, 1989 – 2003)&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; starring Peter Falk, like to hint heavily at the murderer&#39;s identity without overtly revealing it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective either (as in the case of Columbo) quickly sees who the guilty party is through his unusual powers of observation or deduction or the murder is actually show without hiding the killer&#39;s identity. The thrill, then, is in the chase. Who will win the battle of wits and intelligence, the intrepid detective or the crafty killer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite genre of television mysteries, the howdunit is also popular in short stories and novels including R. Austin Freeman&#39;s works Dr. Thorndyke mysteries (1907 – 1942). Freeman claimed to have invented the howdunit style. Others include Patricia Highsmith&#39;s &lt;em&gt;This Sweet Sickness&lt;/em&gt; (1960) and Dorothy&#39;s L. Sayer&#39;s Lord Wimsey short story &quot;The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers&quot; (1928).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be referred to as a &lt;em&gt;howcatchem&lt;/em&gt; or simply the &lt;em&gt;inverted detective story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impossible-crimes&quot;&gt;Impossible Crimes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broad category of mystery stories primarily from the Golden Age of mystery fiction, the impossible crimes subgenre is a catchall for any type of mystery where the crime is committed in such a way that it is seemingly impossible. &#39;Seemingly&#39; being the operative word. Example plots include the classic locked room, where the murder victim is alone in a locked-from-the-inside room when murdered, the no-footprints murder where the body is surrounded by mud or snow but no footprints can be found, and murders committed in front of a mass of witnesses but where the killer was no actually seen committing the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often tied to the Gothic fiction of the Victorian Age, with its emphasis on ghosts, vampires and other supernatural forces that could come and go as they pleased without regard for locked doors or wet snow, the impossible crime stories presented the reader with the mental challenge of an elaborate puzzle. With few clues, they were forced to intuit the possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Dickson Carr was a significant afficiando of the impossible crimes subgenre. He produced a large number of classic stories that included a impossibilities like the vanishing gun in &lt;em&gt;Til Death Do Us Part&lt;/em&gt; (1944). Other impossible crime stories include the &quot;alibi puzzles&quot; like Freeman Wills Crofts &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; Cask (1920) and Christopher Bush&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Case of the Green Felt Hat&lt;/em&gt; (1939).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;paradox&lt;/em&gt; crime stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intuitionist&quot;&gt;Intuitionist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intuitionist school of mystery fiction was a reaction to the realist school and featured genius, eccentric detectives who solved crimes by pure thought, using so-called deductive reasoning to sort out the who and why of a crime. Conan Doyle solidified many of the traits of the intuitionist detectives in his creation of the ultimate deductive detective, Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school of intuitionists was greatly influenced by Anna Katherine Green, Fergus Hume and was hugely popular in the Golden Age era of mysteries. It included Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr, S. S. Van Dine, and A. A. Milne. His introduction to his 1928 novel &lt;em&gt;The Red House Mystery&lt;/em&gt; is called &quot;a virtual manifesto for intuitionist ideas in mystery fiction&quot; by Mike Grost on his excellent site &quot;A Guide to Classic Mystery and Detection&quot; [http://mikegrost.com/classics.htm].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of intuitionist school of mystery fiction stories include &lt;em&gt;The Strangler Fig&lt;/em&gt; (1930) by Dorothy Stockbridge Tillet writing under the pseudonym John Stephen Strange. An early example &lt;em&gt;Ashton-Kirk: Secret Agent&lt;/em&gt; (1912) by John T. McIntyre begins as a Holmesian story but shifts in later chapters to a Golden Age type intuitionist whodunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called the &lt;em&gt;S. S. Van Dine School&lt;/em&gt; of mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inverted&quot;&gt;Inverted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flip of the classic whodunit style of mystery story, the inverted mystery reveals the perp at or very near the beginning of the story. The focus turns then to tracking and capturing the crook. R. Austin Freeman who wrote in his 1912 short story collection &lt;em&gt;The Singing Bone&lt;/em&gt; claimed to have invented the inverted mystery and said he gave the reader all the facts about the criminal and the crime. &quot;But I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence…The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthondy Berkeley Cox, writing as Francis Iles, wrote an early example in &lt;em&gt;Malice Aforethought&lt;/em&gt; (1931). Dorothy L. Sayer&#39;s Lord Peter Wimsey enjoys the inverted mystery in &lt;em&gt;Unnatural Death&lt;/em&gt; (1927) and &lt;em&gt;Strong Passion&lt;/em&gt; (1930).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called a &lt;em&gt;reverse whodunit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;howcatem&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;howdunit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kidsyoung-adult&quot;&gt;Kids/young adult&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fan of mystery fiction, no matter his or her age, fails to remember days of their youth spent reading &lt;em&gt;The Hardy Boys&lt;/em&gt; created by Frank and Joe Hardy (first appearing in 1927) or the &lt;em&gt;Nancy Drew&lt;/em&gt; series, created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer (first appearance in 1930) of kid and young adult mysteries. Nor will we forget the hours spent gleefully watching the Scooby-Doo cartoon series (starting 1969) with Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma unmasking crooks as they tootled around in their Mystery Machine van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subgenre continues to be one of the most popular areas of mystery fiction and may follow the general genre constraints of any of the other subgenres, from Holmesian to Cozy or Golden Age puzzle and locked room mysteries. This genre includes books that range from young child picture book mysteries like the 2010 &lt;em&gt;What Really Happened to Humpty?: From the Files of a Hard-Boiled Detective&lt;/em&gt; by Jeanie Franz Ransom and illustrated by Stephen Axelsen to the &lt;em&gt;Encylopedia Brown&lt;/em&gt; series of 29 novels by Donald J. Sobol, first published in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;child mystery fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legal-mystery&quot;&gt;Legal Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all love to hate lawyers and many of us would probably like to see more of them on the wrong end of a mystery or murder plot, but the legal mystery subgenre is one place we enjoy seeing lawyers succeed. Perhaps its because we tend to identify with the hapless victims accused of a crime they didn&#39;t commit that these legal eagles try to help. The genre follows the legal proceedings as an often underpaid and overworked attorney seeks to prove his client innocent while forcing the true guilty party to confess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps best known in literature are Earle Stanley Gardner&#39;s 82 novels and numerous short stories starring Perry Mason (published from 1933 – 1973, and several posthumously), not to many numerous television and film adaptions. &lt;em&gt;The Spider Lily&lt;/em&gt; (1953) by Bruno Fischer is an example of the legal mystery that takes place both inside and outside the courtroom. Harper Lee&#39;s &lt;em&gt;To Kill A Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; is a classic example of the legal mystery genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;courtroom dramas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;locked-room&quot;&gt;Locked Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locked room mystery is a narrower interpretation of the impossible crime subgenre in which the crime is committed and the killer escapes, seemingly from inside a locked room. The circumstances of the murder would indicate some kind of supernatural criminal, capable of entering and leaving a locked room without leaving a trace or breaking a lock. However, there is nearly always, at least in the best examples, a perfectly rational explanation for how the crime was committed. It just takes an eagle-eyed detective and a bit of deductive reasoning to figure out the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although typically a Golden Age favorite, the genre conventions can actually be seen as far back as Old Testament writings, specifically the tale of &quot;Bel and the Dragon&quot; where Daniel debunks the worship of an idol that supposedly eats food offerings left in a sealed room (Book of Daniel 14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Dickson Carr (also writing as Carter Dickson) is heralded as the premier author of locked room mysteries. His novel &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Man&lt;/em&gt; (1935) was voted the best locked room mystery by a panel of authors and critics. Others include Lawrence Block&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Burglars Can&#39;t Be Choosers&lt;/em&gt; (1977), Agatha Christie&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Murder in Meopotamia&lt;/em&gt; (1936), and S. S. Van Dine&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Canary Murder Case&lt;/em&gt; (1927).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called an &lt;em&gt;impossible crime story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;medical-mystery&quot;&gt;Medical Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical mystery subgenre is a particular take on the amateur sleuth subgenre of mystery fiction. The story revolves around the death of a patient under suspicious circumstances. Oftentimes, the investigator is a doctor (hence its inclusion in the amateur detective category), nurse or other medical practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot may center around odd diseases or medical conditions that are not easily diagnosed, and true to the mystery genre as a whole, are usually intentionally caused by some villain. The genre easily morphs into the thriller category, where the unsuspecting doctor is pitted against the faceless drug company who&#39;s profit-driven motives cause murder in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the professional sleuth category of medical mystery fiction, the medical examiner as a member of the police force is the central character and is tasked with uncovering hidden poisons or other means of murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Andromeda Strain&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Crighton and any of Robin Cook&#39;s novels including &lt;em&gt;Coma&lt;/em&gt; are modern examples but R. Austin Freeman&#39;s Dr. John Thorndyke, a medical doctor who was also a forensic specialist fit this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called a &lt;em&gt;medical thriller&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;noir&quot;&gt;Noir&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically lumped in with hardboiled detective fiction, noir stories stand out from their cousin by nature of the protagonist, the guy or gal at the center of the story. Unlike a hardboiled yarn, where a detective chases clues and crooks, the noir focuses on what Otto Penzler, founder of The Mysterious Press and The Mysterious Bookshop, called the loser, characters that are &quot;doomed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonist is a hapless victim, but one of his own vices. Finding himself in circumstances beyond his control, framed for murder, on the run, the noir protagonist is an everyday guy or gal who, because of something he saw or something he knows, finds himself beset by danger and desperate to escape. And they do not always, or even often, escape to a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noir fiction was first seen in French cinema and referred to both the themes of disillusionment and despair of the characters, and the dark, almost chiaroscuroan lighting methods used in the French films. Like the painters of the Renaissance era who used strong contrasts between light and dark, the noir filmmakers used strong hard lighting against deep shadows to cast characters and scenes in ominous tones, emphasizing and playing on the grittiness of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James M. Cain is regarded as an American pioneer of the noir genre. Others include Cornell Woolrich (&lt;em&gt;Black Alibi&lt;/em&gt;, 1942), Dorothy B. Hughes (&lt;em&gt;The Bamboo Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, 1941), Jim Thompson (&lt;em&gt;Nothing More Than Murder&lt;/em&gt;, 1949), and Elmore Leonard (&lt;em&gt;The Bounty Hunters&lt;/em&gt;, 1953).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as &lt;em&gt;roman noir&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;urban noir&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;neo-noir&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;nihilistic crime fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;police-detective&quot;&gt;Police Detective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A police detective mystery story is a specific type of professional detective story, featuring a detective in the employ of the city or state. It can also include federal agencies and even espionage genres if the focus of the story is on the exploits of the cop as he uses whatever tools are at his disposal to solve the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often closely tied to the police procedural but doesn&#39;t necessarily involve a group of detectives. It can feature a single cop or a pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short story published in September 1837 by William Evans Burton called &quot;The Secret Cell&quot; tells of a London policeman solving the kidnapping of a young girl, and is an early example of a policeman relying on undercover work, evidence collecting and other legwork rather than deductive reasoning to solve a murder. Other examples include Emile Gaboriou&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Monsier Lecoq&lt;/em&gt; (1868) depicting a young policeman&#39;s efforts to solve the riddle of two men&#39;s deaths in a bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also referred to as &lt;em&gt;Police Procedural&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Professional Detective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;police-procedural&quot;&gt;Police Procedural&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This popular subgenre of mystery fiction seeks to accurately depict the crime solving processes of a police department. It may follow a single squad or an entire cadre of beat cops, detectives and forensics scientists. The details of how the police go about collecting evidence and tracking a killer or other criminal are vital aspects of the plot, almost ursurping the characters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genre dates back to Wilke Collins novel &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt;  (1868), which follows a Scotland Yard detective as he collects evidence in the theft of a valuable diamond. However, it has its roots in the scientific detective school dating to Conan Doyle&#39;s Holmes. It became prominent after World War II as the entire genre of mystery fiction turned away from the PI towards the newly respected police forces. As science enabled better forensics, the public fascination with the techniques and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;V as in Victim&lt;/em&gt;  (1945) by Lawrence Treat is general given as the first true police procedural novel. Also popular in film and television, the genre is represented by films &lt;em&gt;The Naked City&lt;/em&gt; (1948) and &lt;em&gt;The Street With No Name&lt;/em&gt; (1948), as well as popular radio and television shows like &lt;em&gt;Dragnet&lt;/em&gt; (radio starting in 1949, transitioning to television in 1951).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;police crime drama&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;crime drama&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;professional-detective&quot;&gt;Professional Detective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professional detective is a crime investigator whose job centers around unearthing clues and solving crime. It can refer to private detectives who are hired to chase wandering husbands or find kidnap victims or police detectives who solve crimes as their day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some definitions may include any professional, from doctors to lawyers, who, in the course of their day jobs, stumble across murders and other crimes and pursue the mystery. However, these characters fail the test because while they may investigate crimes, it is not their primary job and therefore their investigative efforts are firmly in the amateur category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;romantic&quot;&gt;Romantic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gothic novels, particularly the Victorian era Gothics evolved into two types of modern fiction: the horror story and the romance. In the romance category, lies the further subgenre of the romantic mystery in which love and mystery are hopelessly intertwined. Following in the gothic tradition, the romantic mystery follows a beautiful young, if naïve, girl who investigates some oddity like an unearthly scream, dead body or other mystery. Soon she finds herself in danger (see Child/Woman in Peril) but is soon rescued by the dashing hero; love ensues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the women&#39;s lib movement, the damsels in distress became more self-reliant but the elements of romance continued to live on, with themes of betrayal and jealousy as motives for murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story &quot;Scorpion on the Moon&quot; by M. I. H. Rogers, and first published in Street &amp;amp; Smith&#39;s Detective Story Magazine in May 1938, is an example of murder and love as flip sides of the same dangerous coin. Phylis Whitney wrote several modern gothic romance mysteries including &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of the Haunted Pool&lt;/em&gt; (1960) and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;gothic romance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Victorian gothic&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;love stories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scientific&quot;&gt;Scientific&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific detective story, generally accepted as having been invented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his chemist character Sherlock Holmes, puts a great emphasis on the hard sciences like chemistry and biology, as well as pseudo-sciences like phrenology to uncover and decipher clues. The style gained ground during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as science itself became more important to daily life and new theories of evolution, astronomy, the biological sciences and chemistry abounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until authors like L. T. Meade and Halifax&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Stories from the Diary of a Doctor&lt;/em&gt; (1894) that individual stories focused on using the scientific method applied to solving murder and other crimes. R. Austin Freeman&#39;s character Dr. Thorndyke followed in an outstanding body of work, including more than 60 novels and short stories from 1907 to 1942. Freeman, himself, is said to have conducted the actual experiments that his character Dr. Thorndyke performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant stories include Mary Roberts Rinehart&#39;s Miss Pinkerton stories (1904), and the works of Nigel Morland, Helen Reilly, and Hugo Gernsback, editor of pulp science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/em&gt; (beginning publication in 1926), wrote numerous scientific detective stories. These and others are discuss in the article &quot;Scientific Detection&quot; by historian Sam Muskowitz and in &lt;em&gt;The Encylopedia of Mystery and Detection&lt;/em&gt; (1976), edited by Otto Prenzler and Chris Steinbrunner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;suspense&quot;&gt;Suspense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the suspense type mystery story is more a method of telling the story and is present in some form in most types of mystery fiction, many stories rely heavily on the elements of suspense to carry the story. It is similar to the thriller genre of mystery fiction but typically takes a slower pace, allowing the tension to build as events plod along like a slow drip faucet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common in inverted or howdunit mysteries, suspense detective stories deemphasize the journey to uncover and make sense of clues and focus instead on raising the stakes for the detective or other protagonist as he pursues the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often featured in stories about larger villains than the average jealous husband or genteel Golden Age murderer, the suspense story may reveal the villain early but leave the reader guessing as to whether the detective can outwit her foe or be doomed to become another victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspense is part and parcel to most mysteries but specifically suspense-driven mystery stories include Francis Iles (penname of Anthony Berkeley) who wrote &lt;em&gt;Before the Fact&lt;/em&gt; (1932) and Steig Larrson&#39;s trilogy starting with &lt;em&gt;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&lt;/em&gt; (2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also referred to as &lt;em&gt;thriller&lt;/em&gt; mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thriller&quot;&gt;Thriller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically a twin of the suspense genre of mystery and detective fiction, the thriller differentiates itself from the suspense or other mystery style of writing with its frantic pace and high stakes. It is often a race against time to stop a serial killer from plying his trade again or on a larger scale, poisoning a city&#39;s water supply. Many noir and hardboiled style mysteries employ the elements of a thriller, keeping the reader off balance by the quick and hard hitting action of the detective or dupe in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The points of the plot build and continue to add tension until the blow-out climax when the grit and determination of the sleuth are tested against an overwhelming foe. It is a villain-driven plot and therefore typically falls in the inverted genre of mystery story. And rather than racing to find the killer, the sleuth is usually tasked with escaping a trap before his own death or otherwise stopping a pending villain-induced disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/em&gt; (1915) by John Buchan is regarded as the earliest example of the thriller mystery. Other fine examples include films like many of Alfred Hichcock&#39;s films, especially &lt;em&gt;Dial M for Murder&lt;/em&gt; (1954) and &lt;em&gt;The Riddle of the Sands&lt;/em&gt; (1903) by Erskine Childers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;suspense&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;horror&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;or end-of-your-seat&lt;/em&gt; mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;true-crime&quot;&gt;True Crime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technically a nonfiction genre, true crime stories are nonetheless part of the canon of mystery subgenres. It examines, as the title would indicate, actual crimes and seeks to tell, in as honest a way, the story of that crime. Typically, the crimes are sensational murders or sprees. Also popular are biographies of well-known serial killers like Ted Bundy. The genre was also popular in the later years of the pulp detective magazine, with stories told of men like Bluebeard, who murdered his wives, to stories of gangland hits. They may or may not have been true stories but were littered with photographs that seemed to authenticate the realism presented in the pulp true crime magazines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the most well-known examples of true crime are &lt;em&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/em&gt; (1974), the true story of the Manson family murders written by Vincent Bugliosi; and &lt;em&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/em&gt; (1966) detailing the brutal, execution-style 1959 murder of the Herbert Clutter Kansas family by two ex-cons and their subsequent arrest, trial and execution by hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often called a &lt;em&gt;nonfiction novel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whodunit&quot;&gt;Whodunit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whodunit is the classic mystery or crime story, usually involving a murder, a sleuth of some variety and a hodgepodge of clues that lead the detective and the reader down blind alleys reeking of red herrings to the last-page reveal of the dastardly killer. It is a complex, plot-driven example of the detective yarn that gives readers an equal opportunity to scrutinize the evidence and solve the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonist is often an eccentric amateur or semi-professional detective who is somehow connected with either the victim or the suspect, but not the final killer. The term was coined in the mid-1930s and first appeared in the pages of &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genre flourished during the Golden Age of British mystery fiction, with its puzzle and locked room cases of murder and serialized and often dotty detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilke Collin&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt; (1868) is generally regarded as the first true whodunit. Others include Gaston Leroux&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&lt;/em&gt; (1907), A. A. Milne&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Red House Mystery&lt;/em&gt; (1922), John Dickson Carr&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Man&lt;/em&gt; (1935), and Rex Stout&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The League of Frightened Men&lt;/em&gt; (1935).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called a &lt;em&gt;whodunnit&lt;/em&gt; (two &#39;n&#39;s&#39;), &lt;em&gt;who done it&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;who did it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even a remotely exhaustive list of potential categories, breakdowns or tags with which to identify and classify a mystery, but a good start. Remember when looking at your mystery, whether one you&#39;re reading or one you&#39;re writing, that it may not fit cleanly in a single classification. Make a mental list of the various characters, settings, scenes and then decide what subgenre best describes your story.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To trace the origin and history of the mystery story is simply to trace the origin and history of man&#39;s mind. Mystery stories were told and wonder tales invented before the days of old Rameses, before the Sphinx was hewn or Samson born. And indeed the rousing of latent curiosity, the tempting with a promise to divulge, which is the vital principle of the mystery story, began no later than with the subtlety of the Primal Serpent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no country which has not its quota of traditional and folk-lore tales, founded almost invariably on some element of mystery, surprise or suspense. And why? Because the interest of the eternal audience is &quot;gripped&quot; by a desire to know the unknown. Because the ancients told and retold stories of mystery with never failing success. These tales lived. Translated, rewritten, paraphrased, they are still living, because of their ever new appeal to the very human trait of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ancient-mystery-tales&quot;&gt;Ancient Mystery Tales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the story of &quot;The Clever Thief.&quot; It comes from the Tibetan, from an ancient Buddhist book that goes back nearly a thousand years. But even then it was not new. Missionaries had carried it thither from India in an odd corner of their bags, or in some chamber of the memory not filled with the riddles of being. Where did they get it? Who can say? It was old when Herodotus wandered through sun-lit Egypt twenty-four centuries ago, gleaning tales from the priests of Amen and of Ptah. He tells it, point for point, as did those Buddhist missionaries, but lays it in the days of Rameses, nigh four thousand years ago. Everything is there; the cutting off of the head to elude detection, the tricks by which the relatives mourn over the headless trunk, the snare set for the thief and his outwitting it. And that same tale, like good merchandise, was carried both east and west. It found its way to India, over the vast Himalayas, to the gray roof of the world. It came with equal charm to the Mediterranean isles, up the Adriatic coasts, and as far as Venice. There Ser Giovanni told it, transmogrifying Pharaoh of the Nile into a worshipful Doge, as he had already been made over into a Buddhist magnate, but in no way altering the motive, the suspense, the artfulness of the tale. What is this story then? Is it Venetian? Is it Pharonic? Is it Greek? Is it Tibetan? It is all these, and perhaps something more, vastly older than them all. Its craft, mayhap, goes back tot that primal serpent who, more subtle than all the beasts of the field, has ever inspired darkling feints and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories whose motive is a subtly discerned clew are not less primordial. The most vivid of these tales of deduction are, perhaps, those which come to us through the Arabs, in their treasure store, &quot;The thousand and one nights.&quot; The Arabs gleaned them from every land in southern Asia, and from most ancient Egypt, in those days when Moslem power overshadowed half the world. And then they retold them with a charm, a vivid freshness, a roguishness, and a dash of golden light through it all that make them the finest story-tellers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we fix the dates of these Arabian stories? Only in a general way. Some of them came from Cairo, some from Syria, some from the Euphrates and Tigris Valley, some from Persia and India and China; and they were gathered together, it would appear, in the century before Shakespeare was born, by some big-hearted, humorous fellow, among the great anonymous benefactors of mankind. But he made no claim of inventing them. If he had he would have been laughed at for his pains. For old men had heard them from their grandfathers, generation after generation, and the gray grandsires always began to tell them, saying: &quot;So &#39;twas told to me when I was such a tiny child as thou art.11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though many of these tales excite merely wonder and surprise, others have the germ of that analytic deduction from inconspicuous clues, that we call ratiocination, or the detective instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an Arabic story, called &quot;The Sultan and his Three Sons.&quot; From this we quote two illuminative passages which employ the principle of deductive analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they stinted not faring till the middle way, when behold they came upon a mead abounding in herbage and in rain-water lying sheeted. So they sat them down to rest and to eat of their victual, when one of the brothers, casting his eye upon the herbage, cried, &quot;Verily a camel hath lately passed this way laden half with Halwa-sweet- meats and half with Hamiz-pickles.&quot; &quot;True,&quot; cried the second, &quot;and he was blind of an eye.&quot; Hardly, however, had they ended their words when lo! the owner of the camel came upon them (for he had overheard their speech and had said to himself, &quot;By Allah, these three fellows have driven off my property, inasmuch as they have described the burden and eke the beast as one- eyed&quot;) and cried out, &quot;Ye three have carried away my camel!&quot; &quot;By Allah we have not seen him,&quot; quoth the Princes, &quot;much less have we touched him;&quot; but quoth the man, &quot;By the Almighty, who could have taken him except you? and if you will not deliver him to me, off with us, I and you three, to the Sultan.&quot; They replied, &quot;By all manner of means; let us wend to the sovereign.&quot; So the four hied forth, the three princes and the Cameleer, and ceased not faring till they reached the capital of the King.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Presently, asked the Sultan, &quot;What say ye to the claims of this man and the camel belonging to him?&quot; Hereto the Princes made answer, &quot;By Allah, O King of the Age, we have not seen the camel much less have we stolen him.&quot; Thereupon the Cameleer exclaimed, &quot;O my lord, I heard yonder one say that the beast was blind of an eye; and the second said that half his load was of sour stuff.&quot; They replied, &quot;true, we spake these words;&quot; and the Sultan cried to them, &quot;Ye have purloined the beast, by this proof.&quot; They rejoined, &quot;No, by Allah, O my Lord. We sat us in such a place for repose and refreshment and we remarked that some of the pasture had been grazed down, so we said: This is the grazing of a camel; and he must have been blind of one eye as the grass was eaten only on one side. But as for our saying that the load was half Halwa-sweetmeats and half Hamiz-pickles, we saw on the place where the camel had knelt the flies gathering in great numbers while on the other were none; so the case was clear to us (as flies settle on naught save the sugared) that one of the panniers must have contained sweets and the other sours.&quot; hearing this the Sultan said to the Cameleer, &quot;O man, fare thee forth and look after they camel; for these signs and tokens prove not the theft of these men, but only the power of their intellect and their penetration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later Voltaire used this method for his &quot;Zadig,&quot; Poe for his &quot;Dupin,&quot; and Gaboriau for his &quot;M. Lecoq;&quot; while later still it reappeared as the basis of the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of &quot;The Visakha&quot; is nearly a thousand years old, but the following quotation will prove that the element of acute observation is the same as that described in a previous story proving the wisdom of Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After she had taken charge of the boy the father died. A dispute arose between the two women as to the possession of the house, each of them asserting that it belonged to her. They had recourse to the King. He ordered his ministers to go to the house and to make inquiries as to the ownership of the son. They investigated the matter, but the day came to an end before they had brought it to a satisfactory conclusion. In the evening they returned to their homes. Visakha again questioned Mrgadhara, who told her everything. Visakha said, &quot;What need is there of investigation? Speak to the two women thus: &#39;As we do not know to which of you two the boy belongs, let her who is the strongest take the boy.1 When each of them has taken hold of one of the boy&#39;s hands, and he begins to cry out on account of the pain, the real mother will let go, being full of compassion for him, and knowing that if her child remains alive she will be able to see it again; but the other, who has no compassion for him, will not let go. Then beat her with a switch, and she will thereupon confess the truth as to the whole matter. That is the proper test.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mrgadhara told this to the ministers, and so forth, as is written above, down to the words, &quot;The king said, &#39;The Champa maiden is wise.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;riddle-stories&quot;&gt;RIDDLE STORIES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riddle Stories, as we have chosen to designate them, are Mystery Stories concerned with a question and answer of absorbing interest, but one which in no way implies or includes the work of a detective, either professional or amateur. As a rule, Riddle Stories are not based upon a crime, but on some mysterious situation which is apparently inexplicable, but which turns out to have a most rational and logical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-notable-riddle-stories&quot;&gt;Some Notable Riddle Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Sending Of Dana Da&quot; by Kipling, is one of the best stories of this type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have such a commonplace, ordinary medium as kittens, so employed as to make an unsolvable riddle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a man who hates cats wakes up in the morning and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast, or puts his hand into his ulster pocket and finds a little half-dead kitten where his gloves should be, or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dress shirts or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh strapped on his saddlebow and shakes a little sprawling kitten from its folds when he opens it, or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair, or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt, or wriggling among his boots, or hanging, head downward, in his tobacco jar, or being mangled by his terrier in the veranda—when such a man finds one kitten, neither more nor less, once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be, he is naturally upset. When he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a manifestation, an emissary, an embodiment, and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature, he is more than upset. He is actually distressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one could know the truth until told and the explanation is entirely logical and satisfactory. Indeed, as the author says, finally: &quot;Consider the gorgeous simplicity of it all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clever Riddle Story is one by Cleveland Moffett, entitled &quot;The Mysterious Card.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this story, a New Yorker, while in a Paris restaurant, is presented with a card by a charming and richly clad lady. The card bore some French words written in purple ink, but not knowing that language he was unable to make out their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He returned at once to his hotel to inquire concerning the message on the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Proceeding directly to the office and taking the manager aside, Burwell asked if he would be kind enough to translate a few words of French into English. There were no more than twenty words in all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, certainly,&quot; said the manager, with French politeness, and cast his eyes over the card. As he read, his face grew rigid with astonishment, and, looking at his questioner sharply, he exclaimed: &quot;Where did you get this, monsieur?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Burwell started to explain, but was interrupted by: &quot;That will do, that will do. You must leave the hotel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the man from New York, in amazement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You must leave the hotel now—to-night—without fail,&quot; commanded the manager, excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now it was Burwell1 s turn to grow angry, and he declared heatedly that if he wasn&#39;t wanted in this hotel there were plenty of others in Paris where he would be welcome. And, with an assumption of dignity, but piqued at heart, he settled his bill, sent for his belongings, and drove up the Rue de la Paix to the Hotel Bellevue, where he spent the night. The next morning he met the proprietor, who seemed to be a good fellow, and, being inclined now to view the incident of the previous evening from its ridiculous side, Burwell explained what had befallen him, and was pleased to find a sympathetic listener.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, the man was a fool,&quot; declared the proprietor. &quot;Let me see the card; I will tell you what it means.&quot; But as he read, his face and manner changed instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a serious matter,&quot; he said sternly. &quot;Now I understand why my confrere refused to entertain you. I regret, monsieur, but I shall be obliged to do as he did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Simply that you cannot remain here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With that he turned on his heel, and the indignant guest could not prevail upon him to give any explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see about this,&quot; said Burwell, thoroughly angered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is a succession of the hero&#39;s unfortunate experiences in endeavoring to solve the mystery of the card. He referred it to his dearest friend, to a detective agency, to the American Minister, and finally to his wife, but in every case the reader of the card turned from him in horror and dismay and refused to see or speak to him again. In the sequel to the story, called &quot;The Mysterious Card Unveiled&quot; the mystery is explained to the satisfaction of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the best Riddle Story of its kind ever written is that masterpiece of Frank R. Stockton, &quot;The Lady or The Tiger?&quot; but this principle of leaving a question unanswered is not to be advised for any writer not possessing Stockton&#39;s peculiar genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as short-stories, there are many entire novels with a mystery interest but which are in no sense Detective Stories. &quot;The Woman In White&quot; is a good example. This book is said to have been the most popular serial story ever printed. On the publication day of the weekly in which the story was appearing in parts, the street in front of the office was thronged with people anxiously waiting for a new instalment of the adventures of Laura Fairleigh, Ann Catherick, the treacherous Baronet, and the diabolically fascinating Count Fosco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret of Collins&#39;s power lies not in mere description but in suggestion. He excites us not by what he tells us but what he does not tell us. The compelling interest which holds the reader of &quot;The Woman In White&quot; is due less to the vivid description of dramatic incidents than to the artful suggestion of some impending fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-nature-of-the-riddle-story-and-its-types&quot;&gt;The Nature of the Riddle Story and its Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing feature of the Riddle Story is that the reader should be confronted with a number of mysterious facts of which the explanation is reserved till the end. Now this reservation of the final solution, in order to pique the reader&#39;s curiosity, excite his ingenuity, and lead him on to an unexpected climax, is a quite legitimate artistic effect. The only question to be asked about it in any particular instance is whether it succeeds, whether the effect is really accomplished? And for its success two primary qualifications are necessary,—first, that the mystery should really be mysterious; second, that the explanation should really explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Riddle Story, then, is based entirely on a puzzle whose solution is a clever trick of the author and usually not to be guessed by the reader. Unlike the Detective Story, there are no clues, either true or misleading. The reader goes swiftly from his first surprise to sustained wonder, and then to an intense and abiding curiosity that lasts until the solution is flashed upon him. The plot is meant to catch the reader napping, and seldom indeed is he wide awake enough to solve the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct type of Riddle Story is that which describes a search for lost treasure. In so far as the searchers encounter mysterious conditions, or the reader is held in suspense concerning the meaning or outcome of the situations, in so far is the tale a Riddle Story. But to be a real Riddle Story, the mystery must be carefully built up, sustained and finally revealed with careful and coherent sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe&#39;s story, &quot;The Oblong Box,&quot; is one of the greatest Riddle Stories ever written. The mystery is seemingly inexplicable. The interest is intense and the conditions partake of all the elements of ghastliness and horror. The solution is unguessable but entirely logical, and Poe&#39;s inimitable workmanship makes the story a masterpiece of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally clever, in a totally different vein, is Kipling&#39;s &quot;His Wedded Wife,&quot; and, different still, Aldrich&#39;s &quot;Marjory Daw.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of these, the surprise is perfect, and so inherent a part of the plot, so skillfully and swiftly worked up, that all demands of the true Riddle Story are complied with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some Riddle Stories the interest is not in the unraveling of the web, but in the weaving of it. In De Quincey&#39;s &quot;The Avenger&quot; this is the case, and also in Bulwer&#39;s &quot;A Strange Story.&quot; It is the strangeness of the story that captivates in these instances. The maze of mystery and hazard, and the confidence that it will all be made plain to us at last, provide sufficient charm to the lover of the Riddle Story. Crime and its detection have no part here, but mystery and paradox reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sort of Riddle Story employs the cypher or cryptogram plot, but this is of such importance as to require a chapter to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe&#39;s &quot;Gold Bug&quot; includes both the cryptogram and the buried treasure, and is of course the greatest story built upon either or both of these plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novel by James DeMille is called &quot;The Cryptogram,&quot; and the cypher is the main point of the story. But more often, cypher or secret writing is used as a side issue or a picturesque device in a stronger mystery plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Technique of the Novel&quot; Prof. Chas. F. Horne thus discusses the mystery story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the tale of the Improbable, the story that depends chiefly upon plot, external or action plot. It deals with surprise, with mystery, with the unexpected. It sees truth perhaps, but only the oddities of truth, where verity fixes a feeble hope upon coincidence, or upon ignorance, and usually gropes blindly toward that comfortable travesty of material payment for immaterial efforts which man miscalls &#39;poetic justice&#39;. Such a novel may be either:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;1. The story of fear, which holds the excited reader shivering in darkness, by means of hinted horrors or by spectres frankly visible. Such visions haunt the &#39;Castle of Otranto&#39; and Mrs. Radcliffe&#39;s more elaborate work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;2. The story of intrigue, of cunning bad folks and rather idiotic good ones, of subtle schemes, intricate knaveries, and surprising secrets coming to light at just the dramatic moment needful for the triumph of virtue and defeat of vice. If one may do so without seeming to belittle the work, I would suggest &#39;Tom Jones&#39; as showing the perfection of this sort of plot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;3. The detective story, in which the plot is deliberately presented upside down. Consequences are first shown, and then worked backward to their causes, the steps being all suggested, yet made as unexpected as possible, that the reader may exercise his own wits and join the detective in an effort to solve the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;4. The novel of the unknown, the story of strange suggestion, which reaches beyond man&#39;s knowledge of his cosmos, not to terrify and amaze, but to analyze and understand, to suggest possibilities and questions, to see human nature in new lights, as Hawthorne does in &quot;Sep- timius Felton,&quot; or Mr. Wells in his &#39;War with Mars&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-working-classification&quot;&gt;A Working Classification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is obvious that the various types or kinds of mystery story cannot be classified with exactness; so they may be generally divided into three groups—a broad classification which will best suit our purpose: Ghost stories. Riddle stories, and Detective stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the earliest literature the supernatural was a strong element. Its appeal was not only to curiosity, but equally if not more to wonder, awe, and terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In safe surroundings, people like to be frightened. The baby crows with delight when we jump at him and say, &quot;boo!&quot; Children huddle together in ecstasy when listening to bugaboo tales; and grown-ups read and write ghost stories with intense enjoyment of their inexplicable horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though detective stories may receive an unjust opprobrium, yet ghost stories are admitted to the inner circles of literature and art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the days of the Witch of Endor, the superhuman personage has had an exalted place in literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare, Dickens, and Washington Irving number among their characters ghosts who became famous. And in latter days, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling and F. Marion Crawford have given us ghosts well worthy of their literary predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story founded on the supernatural is a distinct branch of the Mystery Story, and except for the principle of Question and Answer, has little in common with the other two branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ghost-story&quot;&gt;The Ghost Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fascination of this realm of experience, which is traditional from age to age, yet always elusive, is undeniable. Few men have seen ghosts, or will confess that they have seen them. But almost everybody knows some one of the few. Haunted houses are familiar in all neighborhoods, with the same story of the roistering sceptic who will gladly pass the night alone in the haunted chamber, and give monsieur the ghost a warm welcome; but who, if not found dead in the morning, emerges pale and haggard, with a settled terror in his look, and his lips sealed forever upon the awful story of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mansions in country places are advertised for sale or hire, with the attraction of a well regulated ghost, who contents himself until driving up at midnight with a great clatter of outriders, and rumble of wheels, and brisk letting down of steps, and a bustling entrance into the house, and then no more. Staid gentlemen remember in their youth awaking in a friend&#39;s house in the summer night just in time to see the vanishing through the long window of a draped figure; a momentary pausing on the balcony outside; the sense of a penetrating, mournful look; then a vanishing; and at breakfast the cheery question of the host, &quot;Did you see the lovely Lady Rosamond?&quot; and a following tale of hapless love and woe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As George William Curtis tells us, in &quot;Modern Ghosts&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The literature of ghosts is very ancient. In visions of the night and in the lurid vapors of mystic incantations, figures rise and smile or frown and disappear. The Witch of Endor murmurs her spell and &#39;an old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle.&#39; Macbeth takes a bond of fate, and from Hecate&#39;s caldron, after the apparition of an armed head and that of a bloody child, &#39;an apparition of a child crowned, with a tree in his hand, rises.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The wizard recounts to Lochiel his warning vision, and Lochiel departs to his doom. There are stories of the Castle of Otranto and of the Three Spaniards, and the infinite detail of &#39;singular experiences,&#39; which make our conscious daily life the frontier and border and of an impinging world of mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The most refined psychological speculation may extend the range of observation. But the &#39;mocking laughter1 of desert places, the cry of the banshee, the sudden impression of a presence, the strange and fanciful popular superstitions, as they are called, in the same way that un- apprehended physical conditions are sagely called nervous prostration—what is the key to them all? What is a hallucination? Who shall say conclusively that it is the thing that is not? And if it be, whence is it, and why?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the technical Ghost Story, as we shall now consider it, the question is certain to arise; &quot;What was It?&quot; And the answer must be &quot;A ghost!&quot;—that is an inexplicable supernatural manifestation of some sort. A rational and material explanation, as of a human being impersonating ghost, or, a mechanical contrivance responsible for mysterious sounds, takes the story out of this class at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling&#39;s tale called &quot;My own true ghost story&quot; is not a ghost story at all; it is an exceedingly interesting riddle story. But &quot;The Phantom &#39;Rickshaw&quot; by the same author is one of the best of ghost stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only must the ghost be a real ghost, but the effect of the supernatural must permeate the whole story, the people being thus more real by contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the reader be the strictest materialist, he must, to enjoy a ghost story, put himself in an attitude of belief in the supernatural for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Julian Hawthorne says, in &quot;The Lock and key library&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A ghost story can be brought into our charmed and charming circle only if we have made up our minds to believe in the ghosts; otherwise their introduction would not be a square deal. It would not be fair, in other words, to propose a conundrum on a basis of ostensible materialism, and then, when no other key would fit, to palm off a disembodied spirit on us. Tell me beforehand that your scenario is to include both worlds, and I have no objection to make; I simply attune my mind to the more extensive scope. But I rebel at an unheralded ghostland, and declare frankly that your tale is incredible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Wilkins&#39; story, &quot;The Shadow on the Wall,&quot; is a perfect Ghost Story, told in a perfect way. There is no material explanation, the shadow on the wall has its own awful meaning, and the commonplace setting of the story throws into relief the weirdness of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ghosts really seen by real people, the fictional Ghost Story has nothing in common. Hundreds of ghosts are annually brought to light in the dragnets of scientific spook catchers. But while these ghosts are interesting in and of themselves, they lack the setting of the Ghost Story of fiction, and without attempting to discuss the truth or falsity of their existence we fall back upon the assertion that a ghost belongs to the category of things naturally incredible. Notwithstanding the subconscious faith that all of us have in the possibility of phantoms, our reason refuses to accept them without proof much more conclusive than we should demand for the establishment of an every-day fact. So extreme is our reluctance to believe in such phenomena that the average man of education, if he saw a spectre with his own eyes, would, on referring the matter to his judgment, prefer to regard the apparition as an illusion, rather than accept it as a supernatural manifestation. The chances are, too, that he would be correct, inasmuch as hallucinations of vision are undeniably frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down in the heart of man there abides a firm belief in the power of the dead to walk upon the earth, and affright, if such be their pleasure, the souls of the living. Wise folks, versed in the sciences and fortified in mind against faith in aught that savors of the supernatural, laugh ideas of the kind to scorn; yet hardly one of them will dare to walk alone through a graveyard in the night. Or, if one be found so bold, he will surely hasten his footsteps, unable wholly to subdue the fear of sheeted spectres which may rise from the grass-grown graves, or emerge from moon-lit tombs, and follow on. For, strangely enough, the dead, if not actually hostile to the living, are esteemed dangerous and dreadful to encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real-life ghost story is largely made up of vehement protestations on the part of the narrator that &quot;This really happened,&quot; and flat-footed inquiries as to &quot;How do you explain it, if you don&#39;t believe in ghosts!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Ghost Story of fiction tranquilly takes the belief in ghosts for granted, and goes on to create delightfully harrowing conditions, an atmosphere of deepest mystery and a problem unsolvable, except by the acceptance of a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ghost need not be an actual character, not even an entity; it may be an impalpable shadow, or an invisible form. Or it may be, as in one story, a fearful pair of eyes that scared the hero of the tale,—and incidentally the reader,—much farther out of his wits than any conventional spectre clanking his chains might do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it is the strange fascination of this fear that attracts the reader to a ghost story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;famous-ghost-stories&quot;&gt;Famous Ghost Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What Was It?&quot; by Fitzjames O&#39;Brien, is a typical Ghost Story of horror. The dreadfulness of the experience is graphically pictured and the hold on the reader&#39;s attention is entirely that of the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A parallel story is Maupassant&#39;s &quot;The Horla.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter story is much longer and more elaborate, but the plots are almost identical. The Frenchman&#39;s story is told with a greater art, but is spun out to too great a length, and in some parts the horror is mere hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Ghost Stories with an occult moral, Kipling&#39;s &quot;They&quot; stands pre-eminent. This story has the element of beauty rather than horror, but it is a perfect Ghost Story none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Turn of The Screw&quot; is a wonderful Ghost Story. The supernatural element of its matter, aided by the supernatural element in Henry James&#39; manner is a combination that makes a Ghost Story of distinguishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For stories of sheer hair-raising horror, F. Marion Crawford&#39;s Ghost Stories stand easily in the first rank. &quot;The upper berth&quot; is quite as terrifying a conception as the stories of O&#39;Brien and Maupassant, but the descriptive details give an atmosphere of fright unattained by the other two. As an example of Mr. Crawford&#39;s awful word pictures we append the following extracts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The light was growing strangely dim in the great room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Evelyn looked. Nurse Mcdonald&#39;s crooked shadow on the wall grew gigantic. Sir Hugh&#39;s breath came thick, rattling in his throat, as death crept in like a snake and choked it back. Evelyn prayed aloud, high and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then something rapped at the window, and she felt her hair rise upon her head in a cool breeze, as she looked around in spite of herself. And when she saw her own white face looking in at the window, and her own eyes staring at her through the glass, wide and fearful, and her own hair streaming against the pane, and her own lips dashed with blood, she rose slowly from the floor and stood rigid for one moment, till she screamed once and fell straight back into Gabriel&#39;s arms. But the shriek that answered hers was the fear shriek of the tormented corpse, out of which the soul cannot pass for shame of deadly sins, though the devils fight in it with corruption, each for their due share.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sir Hugh Ockram sat upright in his deathbed, and saw and cried loud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Slowly Nurse Macdonald&#39;s wrinkled eyelids folded themselves back, and she looked straight at the face at the window while one might count ten.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it time?&quot; she asked in her little old, far away voice. While she looked the face at the window changed, for the eyes opened wider and wider till the white glared all round the bright violet, and the bloody lips opened over gleaming teeth, and stretched and widened and stretched again, and the shadowy golden hair rose and streamed against the window in the night breeze. And in answer to Nurse Macdonald&#39;s question came the sound that freezes the living flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That low moaning voice that rises suddenly, like the scream of storm, from a moan to a wail, from a wail to a howl, from a howl to the fear shriek of the tortured dead—he who has heard knows, and he can bear witness that the cry of the banshee is an evil cry to hear alone in the deep night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He was as brave as any of those dead men had been, and they were his fathers, and he knew that sooner or later he should lie there himself, beside Sir Hugh, slowly drying to a parchment shell. But he was still alive, and he closed his eyes a moment, and three great drops stood on his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then he looked again, and by the whiteness of the winding-sheet he knew his father&#39;s corpse, for all the others were brown with age; and, moreover, the flame of the candle was blown toward it. He made four steps till he reached it, and suddenly the light burned straight and high, shedding a dazzling yellow glare upon the fine linen that was all white, save over the face, and where the joined hands were laid on the breast. And at those places ugly stains had spread, darkened with outlines of the features and of the tight-clasped fingers. There was a frightful stench of drying death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Sir Gabriel looked down, something stirred behind him, softly at first, then more noisily, and something fell to the stone floor with a dull thud and rolled up to his feet; he started back and saw a withered head lying almost face upward on the pavement, grinning at him. He felt the cold sweat standing on his face, and his heart beat painfully.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the first time in all his life that evil thing which men call fear was getting hold of him, checking his heartstrings as a cruel driver checks a quivering horse, clawing at his backbone with icy hands, lifting his hair with freezing breath, climbing up and gathering in his midriff with leaden weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yet presently he bit his lip and bent down, holding the candle in one hand, to lift the shroud back from the head of the corpse with the other. Slowly he lifted it. Then it clove to the half-dried skin of the face, and his hand shook as if some one had struck him on the elbow, but half in fear and half in anger at himself, he pulled it, so that it came away with a little ripping sound. He caught his breath as he held it, not yet throwing it back, and not yet looking. The horror was working in him, and he felt that old Vernon Ockram was standing up in his iron coffin, headless, yet watching him with the stump of his severed neck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While he held his breath he felt the dead smile twisting his lips. In sudden wrath at his own misery, he tossed the death-stained linen backward, and looked at last. He ground his teeth lest he should shriek aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps unique amongst Ghost Stories is the one by Mr. Crawford entitled &quot;The Doll&#39;s Ghost.&quot; It would seem difficult to conceive a story of the ghost of a little girl&#39;s doll, that should be neither melodramatic nor ridiculous, but Mr. Crawford accomplished this, and the little sketch, while a true Ghost Story, is pathetic and charming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-humorous-ghost-story&quot;&gt;The Humorous Ghost Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely, and only in the hands of a master, may a Ghost Story be treated with levity. The humorous touch is dangerous in connection with the supernatural. But the whimsical genius of Frank R. Stockton surmounted all difficulties and gave us two delicious humorous Ghost Stories, of which we quote a few lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The figure was certainly that of John Hinckman in his ordinary dress, but there was a vagueness and indistinctness about it which presently assured me that it was a ghost. Had the good old man been murdered, and had his spirit come to tell me of the deed, and to confide to me the protection of his dear—? My heart fluttered but I felt that I must speak. &quot;Sir,&quot; said I.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you know,&quot; interrupted the figure, with a countenance that indicated anxiety, &quot;whether or not Mr. Hinckman will return to-night?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I thought it well to maintain a calm exterior, and I answered:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We do not expect him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am glad of that,&quot; said he, sinking into the chair by which he stood. &quot;During the two years and a half that I have inhabited this house, that man has never before been away for a single night. You can&#39;t imagine the relief it gives me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As he spoke, he stretched out his legs and leaned back in the chair. His form became less vague, and the colors of his garments more distinct and evident, while an expression of gratified relief succeeded to the anxiety of his countenance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Two years and a half!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t understand you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is fully that length of time,&quot; said the ghost, &quot;since I first came here. Mine is not an ordinary case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ghost smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I must admit, however,&quot; he said, &quot;that I am seeking this position for a friend of mine, and I have reason to believe that he will obtain it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Good heavens!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Is it possible that this house is to he haunted by a ghost as soon as the old gentleman expires? Why should this family be tormented in such a horrible way? Everybody who dies does not have a ghost walking about his house.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no!&quot; said the spectre. &quot;There are thousands of positions of the kind which are never applied for. But the ghostship here is a very desirable one, and there are many applicants for it. I think you will like my friend, if he gets it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Like him!&quot; I groaned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The idea was horrible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ghost evidently perceived how deeply I was affected by what he had said, for there was a compassionate expression on his countenance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and as I did so the ghost burst into the room from the doorway behind her. I say burst, although no door flew open and he made no noise. He was wildly excited, and waved his arms above his head. The moment I saw him, my heart fell within me. With the entrance of that impertinent apparition, every hope fled from me. I could not speak while he was in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I must have turned pale, and I gazed steadfastly at the ghost, almost without seeing Madeline, who sat between us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you know,&quot; he cried, &quot;that John Hinckman is coming up the hill. He will be here in fifteen minutes, and if you are doing anything in the way of love-making, you had better hurry it up. But this is not what I came to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have glorious news! At last I am transferred! Not forty minutes ago a Russian nobleman as murdered by the Nihilists. Nobody ever thought of him in connection with an immediate ghostship. My friends instantly applied for the situation for me, and obtained my transfers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the detective story? To entertain, to interest, to amuse. It has no deeper intent, no more subtle raison d&#39;etre than to give pleasure to its readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been argued that its &quot;awful examples&quot; (sometimes very awful!), are meant as cautionary pictures to restrain a possible bent toward the commission of crime. It is held by some that the habit of analytical and synthetical reasoning, requisite to appreciate the solving of these fictional mysteries, is of value in training the mind to logical and correct modes of thinking; the practical application of which, in the everyday affairs of life, proves a valuable asset in the worldly struggle for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. H. E. Dudeney, in the &quot;The Canterbury Puzzles&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is really a practical utility in puzzle-solving. Regular exercise is supposed to be as necessary for the brain as for the body, and in both cases it is not so much what we do as the doing of it, from which we derive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Albert Smith, in one of his amusing novels, describes a woman who was convinced that she suffered from &#39;cob-wigs on the brain.1 This may be a very rare complaint, but in a more metaphorical sense, many of us are very apt to suffer from mental cobwebs, and there is nothing equal to the solving of puzzles and problems for sweeping them away. They keep the brain alert, stimulate the imagination and develop the reasoning faculties. And not only are they useful in this indirect way, but they often directly help us by teaching us some little tricks and &#39;wrinkles&#39; that can be applied in the affairs of life at the most unexpected times, and in the most unexpected ways.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting passage in praise of puzzles, in the quaint letters of Fitzosborne. Here is an extract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The ingenious study of making and solving puzzles is a science undoubtedly of most necessary acquirement, and deserves to make a part in the meditation of both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an art, indeed, that I would recommend to the encouragement of both the Universities, as it affords the easiest and shortest method of conveying some of the most useful principles of logic. It was the maxim of a very wise prince that &#39;he who knows not how to dissemble knows not how to reign;&#39; and I desire you to receive it as mine, that &#39;he who knows not how to riddle knows not how to live.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But though all this may be true as a vague result, it is not the author&#39;s real purpose. He writes solely for entertainment; presumably the entertainment of his audience, but often equally for the entertainment of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inquisition-into-the-curious-is-universal&quot;&gt;Inquisition into the Curious is Universal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective story, and now we include the whole range of mystery or riddle stories, is founded on a fundamental human trait, inquisitiveness. Man is an incarnate interrogation point. The infant&#39;s eyes ask questions before his tongue can do so, and soon the inquiring eyes are supplemented by a little outstretched hand, trying to satisfy a curiosity by the sense of touch. But, once having achieved a vocabulary, however small, he uses it almost entirely to make inquiries, until so prominent becomes this trait, that his conversation is cut off altogether, and he is condemned to be visible but not audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaining further intelligence, his inquiries become more definite and thoughtful, though no less numerous and eager. He seeks books, whether in or out of running brooks; he inquires of authorities, or he reasons out answers for himself, as he grows in body and brain. He meets a friend in the street, he pours out questions. In his business he progresses by one question after another. Is he an inventor? He questions of Nature till he probes her various secrets. Is he a philosopher? He questions his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Mr. Dudeney again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The curious propensity for propounding puzzles is not peculiar to any race or to any period of history. It is simply innate in every intelligent man, woman, and child who has ever lived, though it is always showing itself in different forms; whether the individual be a Sphinx of Egypt, a Samson of Hebrew lore, an Indian fakir, a Chinese philosopher, a mahatma of Tibet, or a European mathematician makes little difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Theologian, scientist, and artisan are perpetually engaged in attempting to solve puzzles, while every game, sport, and pastime is built up of problems of greater or less difficulty. The spontaneous question asked by the child of his parent, by one cyclist of another while taking a brief rest on a stile, by a cricketer during the luncheon hour, or by a yachtsman lazily scanning the horizon, is frequently a problem of considerable difficulty. In short, we are all propounding puzzles to one another every day of our lives—without always knowing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An orator makes his best effects by questions. The Book of Job is impressive largely because it is written in interrogative form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many trite quotations are questions. &quot;What is truth?&quot; or &quot;Is life worth living?&quot; arrest our attention because they are debatable queries. Who is not more interested in the Questions of the Day than in the known facts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. George Manville Fenn, the man who invented a wondrous and mysterious plot for a story deserves a palm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He must have been a deep thinker, one well versed in the philosophy of goose quill, knowing that his story would thrill the reader, and that he had achieved the great point of seizing upon that reader&#39;s imagination, and holding it, so that he would follow the mystery of the fiction to the very end. It may have been the result of some haphazard lucky thought, but still he must have been a careful student of every-day life, and must have duly noted how largely curiosity or the desire to fathom the unknown is developed in the human brain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other human traits, inquiry is inherent to a greater extent and also more largely developed in some minds than in others. Some people say &quot;How do you do?&quot; and wait interestedly for your answer. Others say &quot;How are you?&quot; and without pausing for reply, go on to remark about the weather. But it is the people who are interested in answers who care for detective stories. It is the people who care for the solution of a problem who write and read mystery tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One who has studied these questions from many points of view, and, above all, noted how a story will &quot;catch on,&quot; and almost electrically seize the imagination of the reading world, will constantly see that in the majority of cases the most popular fiction of the day is that in which mystery plays a prominent part—a mystery which is well concealed. This is no secret. It is the natural desire for the weird and wonderful—that hunger for the knowledge of the unknown which began with the forbidden apple; and the practiser of the art in question merely grows for those who hunger, a fruit that is goodly to the eye, agreeable to the taste, and one that should, if he—or she—be worthy of the honored name of author, contain in its seeds only a sufficiency of hydrocyanic poison to make it piquant in savor. It is no forbidden fruit that he should offer, merely an apple that is hard to pick—a fruit whose first bite excites fresh desire, whose taste brings forth an intense longing for more, and of which the choicest and most enticing morsel is cleverly held back to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Dudeney observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is extraordinary what fascination a good puzzle has for a great many people. We know the thing to be of trivial importance, yet we are impelled to master it, and when we have succeeded there is a pleasure and a sense of satisfaction that are a quite sufficient reward for our trouble, even when there is no prize to be won. What is this mysterious charm that many find irresistible? Why do we like to be puzzled? The curious thing is that directly the enigma is solved the interest generally vanishes. We have done it, and that is enough. But why did we ever attempt to do it? The answer is simply that it gave us pleasure to seek the solution—that the pleasure was all in the seeking and finding for their own sakes. A good puzzle, like virtue, is its own reward. Man loves to be confronted by a mystery—and he is not entirely happy until he has solved it. We never like to feel our mental inferiority to those around us. The spirit of rivalry is innate in man; it stimulates the smallest child, in play or education, to keep level with his fellows, and in later life it turns men into great discoverers, inventors, orators, heroes, artists and (if they have more material aims) perhaps millionaires.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the kernel of their interest is resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mystery and its solution designedly set forth in narration, implies a previous sequence unknown to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this re-solution that attracts the alert brain, and stimulates the reader to solve for himself a problem whose answer he will shortly learn. But he wants to learn that answer as corroborative proof of his own solution, and not as a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this instinct great in some, small or perhaps even entirely lacking in others, that makes a mind interested in puzzles or mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;early-riddles&quot;&gt;Early Riddles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enjoyment of puzzles or mysteries is as old as humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First there is the ancient Riddle, that draws upon the imagination and play of fancy. Readers will remember the riddle of the Sphinx, the monster of B?otia, who propounded enigmas to the inhabitants and devoured them if they failed to solve them. It was said that the Sphinx would destroy herself if this one of her riddles were ever correctly answered: &quot;What animal walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?&quot; It was explained by Oedipus, who pointed out that man walked on his hands and feet in the morning of life, at the noon of life he walked erect, and in the evening of his days he supported his infirmities with a stick. When the Sphinx heard this explanation, she dashed her head against a rock and immediately expired. Puzzle solvers may be really useful on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the riddle propounded by Samson. It is perhaps the first prize competition in this line on record, the prize being thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments for a correct solution. The riddle was this: &quot;Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.&quot; The answer was, &quot;A honeycomb in the body of a dead lion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic &quot;Riddle of the Sphinx&quot; is mythological rather than historical, and belongs to the Grecian deity, not the Egyptian Sphinx. Its date is unauthenticated, but at least it wears the halo of antiquity, for Sophocles wrote of it in the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samson has been called the Father of Riddles, but merely because his famous riddle was among the first to creep into print. Doubtless older and better ones were buried in an oblivion from which they can never be disinterred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Out of the eater,&quot; propounded 1200 B.C., does not strike us as an exquisitely clever conceit, but it embodies the true principle of the riddle and of the riddle story. The asker already knew the solution, and that was why the guessers strove to attain a re-solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days riddles were proposed at wedding feasts and other social gatherings, a practice still obtaining to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon, &quot;to prove him with hard questions.&quot; And Solomon, in his turn was addicted to the giving of riddles to Hiram, King of Tyre, who was fined for those he failed to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Egyptians, puzzling was a religious rite and the Sphinx was their goddess. We are told that such was the esoteric religion of the Egyptians that all the priests were riddlers and their religion one vast enigma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recorded ancient riddles are of interest to the antiquarian, but enough has been said here to prove the inherent love of Question and Answer in man&#39;s mind from the earliest ages. From earlier than Samson to later than Sam Lloyd the puzzle has held its own among mental activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And puzzle, in its broader sense includes all branches of mystery or detective stories as well as mere riddles or conundrums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Century Dictionary defines puzzle as &quot;A riddle, toy or contrivance which is designed to try one&#39;s ingenuity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-passion-for-solving-mysteries&quot;&gt;The Passion for Solving Mysteries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the crux of the mystery story. It is designed to try the reader&#39;s ingenuity at re-solution. The exercise of this tried ingenuity is what gives the entertainment or amusement found in a mystery story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of mentality or the kind of mental bias that gives pleasure in puzzling is the same in author and reader. The talent that knits is the same talent that unravels. The propounder uses the same kind of acumen as the guesser, and his pleasure in doing so is of the same sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to say just what this mental faculty is, but we who possess it know that its exercise gives us exquisite enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the athlete rejoices in his muscular prowess, as the musician rejoices in the melodies he makes, as the artist glories in his painted masterpiece, yea, even as the clam is notoriously happy in his own element, so the mental acrobat revels in concentrating all his brain power on an analytical problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowell declared that Poe had two of the prime qualities of genius—&quot;a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis and a wonderful fecundity of imagination.&quot; These two qualities are present to a greater or less degree in every lover of mystery fiction; and it is the degree that determines the intensity of the call of the author and the response of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-literature-of-mystery&quot;&gt;THE LITERATURE OF MYSTERY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes for worthwhileness in mystery fiction of any kind is the puzzle and its answer—not the gruesomeness of a setting or the personality of a hero or the delineation of a character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A liking for mystery fiction is not a mark of poor taste or an indication of inferior intellect. Its readers form an audience greatly misunderstood by other literary people whose mentality lacks this bent. But what especial audience is not misunderstood? Do not many people say to music lovers, &quot;I don&#39;t see how you can sit through Parsifal&quot;? Do not some scoff at people who trail through art galleries, catalogue in hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us concede that a taste for mystery fiction is not universal. We will even admit that in its nicer points the riddle story may be &quot;caviar to the general,&quot; but we will not agree that it is unworthy a place in literature or that it is outside the pale of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rightful-place-of-the-mystery-story-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Rightful Place of the Mystery Story in Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harry Thurston Peck says in &quot;Studies In Several Literatures&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Supercilious persons who profess to have a high regard for the dignity of &#39;literature&#39; are loath to admit that detective stories belong to the category of serious writing. They will make an exception in the case of certain tales by Edgar Allan Poe, but in general they would cast narratives of this sort down from the upper ranges of fine fiction. They do this because, in the first place, they think that the detective story makes a vulgar appeal through its exploitation of crime. In the second place, and with some reason, they despise detective stories because most of them are poor, cheap things. Just at present there is a great popular demand for them; and in response to this demand a flood of crude, ill-written, sensational tales comes pouring from the presses of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But a detective story composed by a man of talent, not to say of genius, is quite as worthy of admiration as any other form of novel. In truth, its interest does not really lie in the crime which gives the writer a sort of starting point. In many of these stories the crime has occurred before the tale begins; and frequently it happens, as it were, off the stage, in accordance with the traditional precept of Horace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The real interest of a fine detective story is very largely an intellectual interest. Here we see the conflict of one acutely analytical mind with some other mind which is scarcely less acute and analytical. It is a battle of wits, a mental duel, involving close logic, a certain amount of applied psychology, and also a high degree of daring on the part both of the criminal and of the man who hunts him down. Here is nothing in itself &#39;sensational&#39; in the popular acceptance of that word.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Therefore, when we speak of the detective story, and regard it seriously, we do not mean the penny-dreadfuls, the dime-novels, and the books which are hastily thrown together by some hack-writer of the &#39;Nick Carter&#39; school, but the skillfully planned work of one who can construct and work out a complicated problem, definitely and convincingly. It must not be too complex; for here, as in all art, simplicity is the soul of genius. The story must appeal to our love of the mysterious, and it must be characterized by ingenuity, without transcending in the least the limits of the probable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a clear and rational definition of the Detective Story as we propose to consider it, and it seems to justify the acceptance of such stories as literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even in the complete absence of necessity for apology, we must consider the rightful place of the Mystery Story in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is neither below nor above other types of story, but side by side with character studies, problem novels, society sketches or symbolic romances; and in so far as it fulfils the requirements of the best literature, just so far it is the best literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bigoted and thoughtless critics who deny the Mystery Story any right to be considered as literature at all. But better judges are better pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from a personal letter of Mr. Arlo Bates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As to whether a Detective Story is literature, it seems to me that the question is not unlike asking whether a man with blue eyes is moral. No story ever took a place as literature on the strength of its plot. I am in the habit of telling my classes that one can no more judge the literary value of a novel from its plot, than one can judge of the beauty of a girl from an X-ray photograph of her skeleton. To exclude detective tales would be greatly to diminish the world&#39;s literary baggage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Brander Matthews tells us in &quot;Inquiries and Opinions&quot; that &quot;Poe transported the detective story from the group of tales into the group of portrayals of character. By bestowing upon it a human interest, he raised it in the literary scale.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Matthews continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Even at its best, in the simple perfection of form that Poe bestowed on it, there is no denying that the Detective Story demanded from its creator no depth of sentiment, no warmth of emotion, and no large understanding of human desire. There are those who would dismiss it carelessly, as making an appeal not far removed from that of the riddle and of the conundrum. There are those again who would liken it rather to the adroit trick of a clever conjurer. No doubt, it gratifies in us chiefly that delight in difficulty conquered, which is a part of the primitive play-impulse potent in us all, but tending to die out as we grow older, as we lessen in energy, and as we feel more deeply the tragi-comedy of existence. But inexpensive as it may seem to those of us who look to literature for enlightenment, for solace in the hour of need, for stimulus to stiffen the will in the never ending struggle of life, the detective tale, as Poe contrived it, has merits of its own as distinct and as undeniable, as those of the historical novel, for example, or of the sea-tale. It may please the young rather than the old, but the pleasure it can give is ever innocent; and the young are always in the majority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps with his inerrant sense of terminology. Professor Matthews struck the right word when he called the Mystery Story inexpensive. It is that, but it is not necessarily cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indiscriminate critic who pronounces all detective stories trash, would be quite as logical and veracious should he call all love stories trash or all historical novels trash. The matter of a detective story is definite and easily invoiced; the manner allows scope as high as poetry or as deep as philosophy or as wide as romance. There is as true literature in Poe&#39;s detective stories as in Bacon&#39;s Essays, though of a different sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent well-known author published a book of clever detective stories anonymously. Asked why, he said that he considered the admission of its authorship beneath his literary dignity. &quot;Because,&quot; he explained, &quot;they are false to life and false to art.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a generalization, nothing could be more untrue. A detective story may be these things, but so may stories in any other field of fiction. It depends on the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to imply that a detective story is necessarily false to life and is false, per se, to art, is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Julian Hawthorne&#39;s very able essay on this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course &#39;The Gold Bug&#39; is literature; of course any other story of mystery and puzzle is also literature, provided it is as good as &#39;The Gold Bug,&#39;—or I will say, since that standard has never since been quite attained, provided it is a half or a tenth as good. It is goldsmith&#39;s work; it is Chinese carving; it is Daedalian; it is fine. It is the product of the ingenuity lobe of the human brain working and expatiating in freedom. It is art; not spiritual nor transcendental art but solid art, to be felt and experienced. You may examine it at your leisure, it will be always ready for you; you need not fast or watch your arms overnight in order to understand it. Look at the nice setting of the mortises; mark how the cover fits; how smooth is the working of that spring drawer. Observe that this bit of carving, which seemed mere ornament, is really a vital part of the mechanism. Note, moreover, how balanced and symmetrical the whole design is, with what economy and foresight every part is fashioned. It is not only an ingenious structure, it is a handsome bit of furniture, and will materially improve the looks of the empty chambers, or disorderly or ungainly chambers that you carry under your crown. Or if it happen that these apartments are noble in decoration and proportions, then this captivating little object will find a suitable place in some spare nook or other, and will rest or entertain eyes too long focused on the severely sublime and beautiful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mystery-story-considered-as-art&quot;&gt;The Mystery Story Considered as Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the detective story at its best is primarily and integrally a work of art. It is like those Chinese carved balls, referred to by Tennyson as, &quot;Laborious orient ivory, sphere in sphere,&quot; and as the mystery story originated in the Orient, there may be some correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective story has been called &quot;ingenious but somewhat mechanical.&quot; Here the stigma lies in the &quot;but.&quot; The detective story is ingenious and mechanical. On these two commandments hang all the laws of mystery fiction writing. Also ingenious and mechanical are the Fixed Forms of verse. Who denies the beauty and art of sonnets and rondeaux, and even sestinas, because they are ingenious and mechanical?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the mosaic worker in Florence picks out his colored bits with utmost skill, care and patience, so the worker in Fixed Forms selects his words and fits them into his inexorable pattern until he achieves his perfect and exquisite result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heraldic devices are not &quot;artistic&quot; in the accepted sense of the word, but they are an art in themselves; ingenious and mechanical, but still art. The Heraldic lions in front of the New York Public Library may not be true to nature&#39;s lions, may not be true to a poetic imagination of a lion, but they are true to the laws of the conventional lion of heraldry, and are therefore art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriental embroidery is art as much as an impressionist picture, though of a different type, and characterized by ingenuity and mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as Lowell says, &quot;genius finds its expression in the establishment of a perfect mutual understanding between the worker and his material,&quot; then we can exclude no serious endeavors from the possibility of being art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the qualities of ingenuity and mechanism are peculiarly fitted to bring about the establishment of just such an understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-claims-of-antagonists-and-protagonists&quot;&gt;The Claims of Antagonists and Protagonists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for a sweeping denouncement of the detective story is the innate propensity of the human mind for bluffing at intellect. Many people would be glad to admit a taste for mystery fiction, but tradition tells them that such things are but child&#39;s play, while a love of ethics or metaphysics betokens a great mind. Ashamed then, of their honest liking for puzzle solving, they deny it, and pretend a deep interest in subjects which really mean little or nothing to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can you read such stuff?&quot; they ask in shocked tones of the puzzle lover, who, with alert brain and bright eyes, is galloping through &quot;The Mystery of the Deserted Wing,&quot; and then they turn with a virtuous yawn, back to the uncut pages of the erudite tome through which they are plodding their weary way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the truly great intellect who understands and knows whereof he thinks, the above does not apply. But so long as men are unwilling to be caught in a liking for &quot;child&#39;s play,&quot; and so long as women yearn after that smattering of abstruse literature which represents to them &quot;a breadth of culture,&quot; so long will the detective story be ostentatiously denounced on the corners of the streets, and eagerly devoured behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are plenty of people of real intelligence who have no taste for Mystery Stories. This proves nothing, for there are also plenty of people of real intelligence who like them. Again we might as well ask, &quot;Does a blue eyed man like cherries?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as many people are fond of the authority of the good and great, let us be definite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a personal letter. President Woodrow Wilson writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fact is. I&#39;m an indiscriminate reader of detective stories and would be at a loss to pick out my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the whole I have got the most authentic thrill out of Anna Katharine Green&#39;s books and Gaboriau&#39;s.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. William J. Rolfe, the famous Shakespearian editor, was exceedingly fond of Mystery Stories and puzzles of all sorts. He especially revelled in the books of charades written by his friend and colleague. Professor William Bellamy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the hasty and inconsiderate judgment that relegates all detective fiction to the trash-pile, might be modified by the knowledge of the college professors and deep-thinking scholars who turn to detective stories for recreation and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well known member of the English Parliament has such a taste for detective literature that his friend speaks thus of him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The weighty work in which the eminent statesman is so deeply engrossed,&quot; he said, &quot;is called &#39;The Great Rand Robbery.1 It is a detective novel, for sale at all bookstalls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The American raised his eyebrows in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&#39;The Great Rand Robbery?&quot;&#39; he repeated, incredulously. &quot;What an odd taste!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not a taste, it is his vice,&quot; returned the gentleman with the pearl stud. &quot;It is his one dissipation. He is noted for it. You, as a stranger, could hardly be expected to know of this idiosyncrasy. Mr. Gladstone sought relaxation in the Greek poets. Sir Andrew finds his in Ga- boriau. Since I have been a member of Parliament, I have never seen him in the library without a shilling shocker in his hands. He brings them even into the sacred precincts of the House, and from the Government benches reads them concealed inside his hat. Once started on a tale of murder, robbery, and sudden death, nothing can tear him from it, not even the call of the division-bell, nor of hunger, nor the prayers of the party Whip. He gave up his country house because when he journeyed to it in the train he would become so absorbed in his detective stories that he was invariably carried past his station.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps such an inordinate relish is not to be entirely commended, but the fact remains that an analytical mentality gets an intense enjoyment out of the solving of puzzles or mysteries, that a differently constituted brain cannot in the least understand or appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to the incontrovertible philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Different men are of different opinions. Some like apples, some like inions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this same thought Henry James voices thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In a recent story, &#39;The Beldonald Holbein,1 it is not my fault if I am so put together as often to find more life in situations obscure and subject to interpretation than in the gross rattle of the foreground.&quot; One could not find a more luminous comment upon his short stories than these words contain. The situations that he prefers are, as he says, &quot;obscure&quot; but &quot;subject to interpretation.&quot; Hawthorne&#39;s situations, however, even when obscure, are always vital. We cannot imagine Hawthorne saying, as James says, &quot;It is an incident for a woman to stand up with her hand resting on a table and look out at you in a certain way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, then, Mr. James gets exquisite satisfaction out of the careful consideration of this incident, why may not another equally great intellect become absorbed in finding out who stole the jewels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curiosity aroused by Mystery Fiction is not then, a mere idle curiosity but an intellectual interest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Netlify and the Noob Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;first bold&quot;&gt;With words or phrases like command line, git, versioning, static site, continuous development, Grunt, Gulp, SSL/HTTPS, redirects, basic auth, OAuth and so many others, web development for the non-developer is intimidating at best. The simple fact is, with so many new and growing technologies, web development is simply more than a little HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I began development of a website for my little publishing business, Tales of Murder Press. I started with WordPress but quickly (and thanks to Josh Kaufman&#39;s book &lt;em&gt;The First 20 Hours&lt;/em&gt;) discovered Jekyll and the wonders of static website development. That, of course, drew me down a rabbit hole of technology that required more and more books and web tutorials to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I hit a wall. How to serve my beautiful (yes, I&#39;m biased, and no, its not really!) Jekyll creation so that the world would beat a path to my virtual door and buy my books? I&#39;m a writer, not a web developer. I know basic HTML and CSS. I can copy JavaScript but can&#39;t write my own. Add in the numerous JS variation and libraries and I&#39;m lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after reading I-don&#39;t-know-how-many blogs, articles and books, I saw a little post about integrating Jekyll with a neat system called Netlify. Besides the nifty name, the concept of simple, straightforward hosting and deployment of my site caught my attention. Soon, I was knee-deep in the article and reading everything I could find in their extensive (albeit sometimes over my head) documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly, there it was. My little site, pushed from my simple _site folder on my Mac to the live web. It had a funny domain name (something like governor-cow-some.random.number). But it was live and so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-the-noob-web-developer&quot;&gt;For the Noob Web Developer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you&#39;re a noob web developer like me but steeped in the idea of best-practice, cutting-edge web dev technology, you won&#39;t go wrong with Netlify. It&#39;s just too easy to get started and as you grow in your knowledge of web dev tech and fully grok all those weird terms I mentioned at the top of this article, you&#39;ll find the depths of Netlify are more than enough to satisfy your every need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me walk you through how I set myself up with Netlify and, if you follow my steps, read the excellent documentation on the site (just Google anything you don&#39;t understand or ask them for help…their tech support has been more than generous with helping me with some very dumb questions), you&#39;ll look up after just a few minutes and find your static site blasted out across the World Wide Web, ready for masses of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1&quot;&gt;Step 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite aspect of Netlify, at least in the beginning since I&#39;ve now upgraded, is the free level of their service. You don&#39;t even have to pay to play! Just create an account and you&#39;re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2&quot;&gt;Step 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to SITES (you&#39;ll see it at the top of the Netlify page once you&#39;ve logged in). There you&#39;ll see a nifty box with a big ole plus sign in it and &quot;NEW SITE&quot;. Just click that and you&#39;re off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;ll ask you if you&#39;d like to do Continuous Deployment and that is a fantastic feature if you&#39;re set up in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. For now, just look to the right-hand side of the screen to the big box that says &quot;Or Do a Quick Manual Deploy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3&quot;&gt;Step 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets stupid simple. Go to your Finder on your computer. Find your generated _site folder or wherever your particular brand of static site generator outputs the fully generated HTML, CSS, JS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the old click-to-select-and-drag that folder (the _site or whatever) from your Finder window to the Manuel Deploy box. Release the mouse button and then watch the magic happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify works behind the scenes to examine your site files and determine if there are any issues with them. If not, it creates a new site on Netlify with some goofy name like upholster-alice or monkey-canisters, or whatev (really a fun part, I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4&quot;&gt;Step 4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on that box and you&#39;ll see a large thumbnail type image of your main page along with the name (the goofy one), domain (probably says, &quot;No custom domain&quot; and the Privacy settings. Below that are links to your Git repo, if you&#39;ve set it up for Continuous Deploy and other more advanced options (that I don&#39;t, as yet, use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll notice a submenu just above all this information with: Settings (this page), Builds, Forms, Access, Notifications, HTTPS, and Upgrade menu options. Click on the Builds item and you&#39;ll find details on the build of you site (what happened when you dragged your folder onto the Manual Deploy spot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, you&#39;ll find all builds and deploy history for this site. Each row has a tiny thumbnail and a Preview link (click this to see the actual live site), Build (whether manual or continuous) and the State (published or in my case at first, an error). If you do see an error, it usually means something is wrong with your static site build and you just need to follow the info provided to sort out any issues. And again, Netlify&#39;s tech support is great in helping a noob sort out the obvious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5&quot;&gt;Step 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, click the Preview link and a new tab in your browser opens, displaying your work of art. Share this link with the world and your work is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-step-6&quot;&gt;(Optional) Step 6+&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or not. You can easily point the goofily-named Netlify build/deploy to a custom domain, like www.MyAwesomelyFantasticWebsiteTheWorldHasToSee.com. Go back to the Settings submenu item and click Edit next to the &quot;Domain: No custom domain&quot;. Fill in the URL you wish to use (be sure to follow their documentation details to set your DNS records properly … this was an area I messed up and AGAIN their tech support, or more accurately one of the founders, sorted me out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that&#39;s set, hit SAVE and very quickly, your beautiful creation will be live at your custom URL. So simple, that even I managed to sort it out and am proud to see my site live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updating-your-netlify-deployed-site&quot;&gt;Updating your Netlify deployed site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And updates? Just as simple. Just drag the newly output _site folder onto the big thumbnail image on the Settings page and it&#39;ll rebuild and redeploy your changes. Nothing could be simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;[Edit: I had someone read this post and she found a typo. I’d written “fold” instead of “folder” in this paragraph. I changed it in Sublime Text 3, saved &amp;amp; reran my Jekyll command to reoutput a new _site folder. Then did the old drag-and-drop redeploy and voila! My fixed article is live again!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it. If you&#39;re a noob like me and just learning about all the wonders and weirdness of web dev, do yourself a favor and tap into Netlify&#39;s goodness and simplicity. Easier than the so-called 5 Minute you-know-who set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-gets-more-but-not-much-complex-from-here&quot;&gt;It gets more (but not much) complex from here!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing, if you are interested in the more complex matters like SSL/HTTPS (now provided as part of any package) or Continuous Deploy from a Git repo, the documentation is extensive and helpful. I&#39;ve only dabbled in these areas but was quickly able to add Command Line deploy and connect my GitHub repo to my Netlify deploy. I also took advantage of the free SSL/HTTPS options (so cool!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more depths to plumb within Netlify and they continue to add new and more robust features (like JAMstack, which I&#39;m just beginning to wrap my head around) to their already bursting collection of features for static website deployment. It&#39;ll only get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For noobs and masters of the web dev environment alike, Netlify provides the technology, security, speed and simplicity to get you on the web faster and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;So drag yourself and your _site folder to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; and get deployed, easy-peasy. Hey, if I can figure it out, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;firstpara&quot;&gt;Ah, the mystery. Does any other form of the story captivate the reader quite like a whodunit, with the intrepid detective facing off with a dastardly killer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most popular form of fiction, it can be seen across the myriad of entertainment today, ranging from shelves of books at your local bookstore or online book retailer to the lists of television programs and movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is the mystery story and where did the modern form come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definition-of-the-mystery-story-form&quot;&gt;Definition of the Mystery Story Form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply defined, the mystery story is a genre of fiction that sets up a puzzle and challenges the reader to unearth the clues to solve the crime or other upset in the status quo. It proposes a question, such as: Who committed the crime? How was it done? What was done and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is up to the reader to follow along with the hero of the story, often a detective—whether someone who claims the title as part of a job or just an interested amateur— to find the clues that will answer the question posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most readers, when they think of a mystery story, think of the murder mystery story popularized by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Allen Poe, Agatha Christie, and Dashiell Hammett, among others. These stories center around the crime of murder and the quest to bring justice by unmasking the killer. The classic whodunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mystery story can also be written from the perspective of the crook; some mystery stories pit ‘good-guy’ crooks against ‘bad-guy’ cops. The caper subgenre typically follows the crooks as they plan and execute their crime, usually stealing some valuable diamond or art work. These fall under the heading of the inverted mystery, or the howdunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery stories sometimes present a supposedly supernatural terror like a haunted house that may or may not have a hidden but natural cause; think of the classic Scooby Doo mysteries where a scary monster keeps the good citizens away from a house, part of town, etc., but is really just some crook who’s trying to counterfeit cash or run folks off so he can capitalize on a hidden oil reserve. Answers the questions of what and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subgenres within the mystery story main genre include: the cozy, locked room, police procedural, amateur or professional sleuth, inverted or howdunit, historical, Golden Age, legal, paranormal, hardboiled, noir, Holmesian, woman/child in peril, caper/heist, espionage/spy…the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many purists might not include capers or crook-centered stories, yarns about things that go bump in the night, or spy thrillers as mysteries, because they revolve around the themes of crime, theft, or violent death and carry with them a sense of suspense with a puzzle—will the daring thief outwit the bumbling cops; will the kids discover the truth behind  the swamp monster mask; will the daring spy escape the evil regime to return with the dangerous information?—they fit the broad definition of the mystery form—a story with a puzzle that challenges the detective, and the reader, to answer the question: whodunit, howdunit, or whydunit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;did-edgar-allen-poe-create-the-modern-detective-story&quot;&gt;Did Edgar Allen Poe create the modern detective story?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most experts, or at least most websites, claim that the modern mystery story originated with Edgar Allen Poe. He is called the “Father of the Detective Story”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worlds-best-detective-crime-and-murder-mystery-books.com/1841.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.MysteryNet.com&quot;&gt;MysteryNet.com&lt;/a&gt;, a leading site “for online mysteries and mystery games” that also discusses the history and origins of the literary form says that the general mystery story form “… as we know [it] today did not emerge until the mid-nineteenth century when Edgar Allen Poe introduced mystery fiction’s first fictional detective, Auguste C. Dupin, in his 1841 story, ‘The Murders in the Rue Morgue.’”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysterynet.com/timeline/history-of-mystery/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a deeper look at the works of Poe and the mystery form of fiction shows that while Poe took the form to a new level and may have introduced readers to the concept of a detective, stories revolving around crime and its aftermath have existed almost since time began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-murder-mystery-amp-the-deep-historical-origins-of-mystery-stories&quot;&gt;The First Murder Mystery &amp;amp; the Deep Historical Origins of Mystery Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; “Then the Lord said to Cain, ‘Where is Abel, your brother?’ And he said, ‘I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?’ &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; He said, ‘What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%204:9-10&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;Genesis 4:9‑10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken from the Bible’s first book, originating from the very beginnings of creation itself, this story tells of Cain murdering his brother Abel out of jealousy and God, cast as a sort of detective, seeking out the killer. Generally accepted to have been written by Moses during the Israelite wandering in the wilderness (1450 – 1410 B.C.E.), this short vignette could easily be the first murder mystery put in written form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the plays of Ancient Greece, like those of Sophocles and Euripides, included elements of mystery and certainly murder in their dramas. Roman mythology also included elements of the mystery story. Indeed, Hercules fought Cacus&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a fire-breathing giant and son of Vulcan, who stole eight of Hercules’ cattle by walking them backwards into a cave, perhaps the first instance of a crook using subterfuge to try to outwit the detective in pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples of ancient mysteries include “Oedipus the King” by Sophocles (430 B.C.E.), a story of patricide; “The Three Apples” from the &lt;i&gt;One Thousand and One Arabian Nights&lt;/i&gt; (800-1300), about a dismembered body found in a heavy locked chest and the vizier’s task of solving the murder in three days; and the Gong’an, or crime-case fiction of the Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) involving government magistrates who solve criminal cases.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelockedroommystery.com/origins-of-mystery-fiction&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ability-to-read-and-the-fascination-with-crime-murder-amp-sensational-executions&quot;&gt;The Ability to Read and the Fascination with Crime, Murder &amp;amp; Sensational Executions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A direct result of the Renaissance and Johannes Gutenberg’s (1398 – 1468) creation of the moveable type press, the general populace of England and Europe began to learn to read. With this new found skill came the desire to read more than just the Bible and other official texts. The insatiable human thirst for drama and intrigue drew people to written accounts of executions and murder trials as recorded by local magistrates and shire sheriffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, &lt;i&gt;The Newgate Calendar&lt;/i&gt;, subtitled &lt;i&gt;The Malefactor’s Bloody Register&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newgate_Calendar&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a monthly bulletin of executions produced by the Keeper of the Newgate Prison in London, was a popular form of story for the general reader. Highly sensational and often embellished, these stories were biographies of notorious criminals and took a high-handed approach to preaching against crimes like murder, theft, and prostitution. They began as compilations of broadsheets and fed on the public fascination with crimes, trials and punishment. The original issue was published in 1773&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/crime/media1/calendar1/facts1/facts.html&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subsequent development of professional police forces, the Bow Street Runners in London (1749) and the Sûreté in France (1812) spawned a number of supposedly carefully collected recollections of actual cases. The Memoirs of a Bow Street Runner by Henry Goddard is a prime example. Their complete genuineness and accuracy are debated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas De Quincy published a seminal work called “On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts” in “Blackwood’s Magazine” in 1827. It is a fictional account of a speech to a gentleman’s club on the aesthetics of murder. It had a significant influence on future mystery and crime authors and was even cited by G. K. Chesterton. It is also the inspiration for &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidmorrell.net/&quot;&gt;David Morrell&lt;/a&gt;’s (father of “Rambo”) 2014 novel &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Fine-Thomas-Emily-Quincey/dp/031621678X&quot;&gt;Murder as a Fine Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which puts De Quincy in the role of murder suspect in a series of ferocious mass murders in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-serialized-mystery-stories-amp-the-advent-of-the-mystery-magazine&quot;&gt;The First Serialized Mystery Stories &amp;amp; the Advent of the Mystery Magazine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the demand for more stories increased from the poor and middle class readers, publishers began to print what became known as the penny dreadfuls, or penny bloods. These cheaply produced periodicals included serialized novels and short stories ranging from Pierce Egan the Elder’s &lt;i&gt;Life in London&lt;/i&gt; (1821 – 1824)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.priceonepenny.info/notes.php&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to Charles Dicken’s many works including &lt;i&gt;The Pickwick Papers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/i&gt;. Typically sold for a shilling, these works were lavishly illustrated and came out as monthly serials&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.priceonepenny.info/notes.php&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap serialized stories appeared in the late 1820s and were sold in weekly editions for a penny each. Subject matter ranged from Gothic thrillers about vampires and ghouls to sensationalized exploits of detectives and criminals. Innovations during the Victorian Era in Britain such as improvements to mass printing, the increased capacity for travel, and an increasingly literate public created a mass market for cheap, popular literature and were priced to be affordable to the working-class&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_dreadful&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the nineteenth century, a new form of cheap novel gained a foothold. Called a &lt;b&gt;yellowback&lt;/b&gt; for its distinct yellow cast covers, created using a technique called chromoxylography, which is a color woodblock printing process, these books were designed to compete with the penny dreadfuls, these book length works were often sordid and sensational, sold cheaply to satisfy the working-class tastes for torrid entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by the Brits, the American mystery writers produced their own versions of the yellowback novels, soon called dime novels, story papers, and thick books. These were the early versions of what later became the popular pulp mystery magazines. Like their British cousins, the dime novels were written quickly, with sensationalist plots and lurid detail. The earliest dime novels were not mysteries, per se, but dealt with general life of the time, such as western adventures featuring real-life characters like Wild Bill Hickok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular mystery characters included “Old Sleuth”, “Nick Carter” and a publication called “The New York Detective Library”, created by Frank Tousey. “The New York Detective Library”, like “The Old Cap Collier Library”, featured a single character that carried through numerous adventures and written by numerous authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally running 32 pages with a black-and-white illustration on the cover, these dime novels and related early pulp magazines evolved quickly, adding pages (up to 200 pages per issue) and Tousey introduced color covers in 1896 as a way to compete with the numerous other publishers vying for the public’s eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late nineteenth century, however, new high-speed printing techniques enabled Frank Munsey, who created the juvenile magazine “The Argosy”, to grow his title into an adult fiction magazine that became the first pulp magazine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dime_novel&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-works-of-the-modern-mystery-story-form&quot;&gt;The First Works of the Modern Mystery Story Form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cited by crime fiction historians as the predecessor of the classic crime novel, &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Caleb Williams&lt;/i&gt; (1749) by William Godwin tells the story of Williams who suspects his master has murdered a neighbor and framed a tenant by planting evidence. Godwin is credited with doing the detective legwork himself to develop the plot, starting with the desired conclusion and working backwards to the beginning in order to spin a well formed mystery story. It is a technique still common in mystery writing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/a-brief-history-of-the-mystery-novel&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. T. A. Hoffman published a novella in 1819 called &lt;i&gt;Mademoiselle de Scudéri, A Tale from the Times of Louis XIV [Das Fräulein von Scuderi.Erzählung aus dem Zeitalter Ludwig des Vierzehnten]&lt;/i&gt;. The novella gained immediate critical and commercial success and is heralded for its exciting, suspenseful plot. Set in Paris, France during the reign of King Louis XIV, it tells of a city under siege by a band of thieves who murder citizens with a deliberate dagger thrust to the heart to steal jewels intended for illicit lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mademoiselle de Scudéri, an elderly poet soon finds herself in the midst of the crime investigation when a succession of events puts her face to face with the supposed killer. Although she herself does not solve the crime, her involvement with the young man accused makes this a fine example of a murder mystery story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, himself, is said to have been influenced by Hoffman’s thriller, as well as by Voltaire’s &lt;i&gt;Zadig&lt;/i&gt; (1747), also a novel of crime, murder, and betrayal, when he wrote “The Murders in the Rue Morge” (1841), which introduces the first recognized detective, C. Auguste Dupin. Dupin is the archetype of the literary detective, displaying the characteristics we have come to expect, including a considerable intellect, creative imagination, and the ability to put himself into the mind of the killer. All traits made more famous by perhaps the single-most famous literary detective of them all, Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after Poe’s creation of Dupin, Wilke Collins(1824 – 1889) published what is alternatively regarded as the first true detective novel, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in White&lt;/i&gt; (1860). The novel was so popular that “…every possible commodity was labeled ‘Woman in White’”, including cloaks and bonnets, perfume, and even music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is based on an eighteenth century case of abduction and wrongful imprisonment. The hero, Walter Hartright, was the first to use techniques later popularized by private detective stories. Collins went on to write more than 30 novels, classified today as “sensation novels”, which are seen as the precursor to detective and suspense fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1887, Irish-Scots physician Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle (1859 – 1930) published the first in a series of short stories in “The Strand” magazine called “A Study in Scarlet”, featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. Eventually appearing in four novels, 56 short stories, and countless films and television series—even called by the Guinness World Records “the most portrayed movie character” in history—Holmes perhaps exemplifies best the image of a literary detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mothers-of-the-detective-novel-significant-contributions-to-the-mystery-story-form-by-women&quot;&gt;The Mothers of the Detective Novel: Significant Contributions to the Mystery Story Form by Women&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first woman to write detective and mystery fiction, American Anna Katherine Green, published &lt;i&gt;The Leavenworth Case&lt;/i&gt; in 1878, and sold a quarter of a million copies. It earned her the title of “The Mother of the Detective Novel” because of the skilled detective work of uncovering hidden fact, often historical, that led to the resolution of the crime. Her techniques are still in use today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green’s success spawned a number of other successful and significant female mystery authors including Mary Roberts Rinehart (known as the American Agatha Christie, although she preceeded the famous British author by 14 years) and Dorothy Cameron Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinehart’s style is said to have a lot in common with the later hardboiled school of detective fiction, and is part of the American school of scientific detection. She is credited with the phrase, “The butler did it.”, which appeared in her novel &lt;i&gt;The Door&lt;/i&gt; (1930) and invented the “Had-I-But-Known” school of mystery writing with &lt;i&gt;The Circular Staircase&lt;/i&gt; (1908). She, herself, was influential on other mystery writers including Helen Reilly and Theodora Du Bois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only publishing nine novels, Dorothy Cameron Disney is nonetheless seen as one of Rinehart’s most gifted followers. &lt;i&gt;Death in the Back Seat&lt;/i&gt; (1939) and &lt;i&gt;The Strawstack Murders&lt;/i&gt; (1938-39) were classically plotted mystery novels. Other works were more social commentary and puzzle plot stories. Her mystery stories bring her closest to the major Golden Age period and style of mystery fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-locked-room-amp-the-beginnings-of-the-golden-age&quot;&gt;The Locked Room &amp;amp; the Beginnings of the Golden Age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-teens, a new form of the mystery gained popularity, the so-called “locked room” mysteries. An early puzzle-style mystery, the locked room presented the detective with a seemingly impossible situation, where the victim is murdered without any way for the killer to enter or exit the room. It is simply locked from inside. The reader is presented with all of the clues and is challenged to figure out how the murderer was able to kill and then vanish into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-teens, the earliest examples of what became known as the Golden Age of mystery and detective fiction began to appear. These mysteries were part of the flourishing British detective novel movement and set the standard for the British mystery. They grew out of the puzzle stories like the locked room and were seen as pure entertainment, as games where the reader matched wits with the author. The murders themselves usually took place off stage and the stories centered around the bucolic settings of English villages and small towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age stories is called the “apex of the [mystery] genre, embodying all of the important elements that make the form so appealing.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~stb27/gadficintro.htm&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is the genre of mystery and detective fiction that introduced the concept of ‘fair play’ on the part of the author, although it was not uncommon for authors to hold back a vital clue that the detective would reveal on the last page. In the late 1920s, Monsignor Ronald A. Knox (1888 – 1957) wrote “The Ten Rules of Detective Fiction”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Knox said that a detective story, “must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_detective_fiction&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age of mystery and detective fiction ran from the earliest examples in about 1913 through the beginning of World War II. Some of the best known British mystery writers today were of this style, including Agatha Christie (1890 – 1976), Dorothy L. Sayers (1893 – 1957), Margery Allingham (1904 – 1966) and Philip MacDonald (1900 – 1980). Not to be outdone, American writers also tackled this popular form and significant contributors include John Dickson Carr (1906 - 1977), Ellery Queen (pseudonym of cousins Frederik Dannay (1905 - 1982) and Manfred Bennington Lee (1905 – 1971)), and S. S. Van Dine (1888 – 1939).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pulps-hardboiled-pis-amp-noir--the-gritty-realism-of-america-1920-to-wwii&quot;&gt;Pulps, Hardboiled PIs &amp;amp; Noir – the Gritty, Realism of America: 1920 to WWII&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the British authors were creating gentile murders, the American authors of the 1920s began to write in a more “realistic” style. When Black Mask magazine was launched in April 1920&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackmaskmagazine.com/history.html&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by literary journalist H. L. Mencken and drama critic George Jean Nathan, it launched a new style of mystery short story and took off where the yellowbacks and dime magazines of the nineteenth century left off. Although best known for its mystery short stories, “Black Mask” was presented “the best stories available of adventure, the best mystery and detective stories, the best romances, the best love stories, and the best stories of the occult.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pulp detective magazine ushered in the era of the hardboiled detective, an anti-hero type who was often hard drinking, hard womanizing, and often at odds with the law himself. Dashiell Hammett, known for &lt;i&gt;The Maltese Falcon&lt;/i&gt; (1930); Raymond Chandler, author of &lt;i&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/i&gt; (1939); Erle Stanley Gardner, creator of Perry Mason, and other pulp masters got their start writing for “Black Mask”. Other significant writers of the hardboiled style include George Harmon Coxe (1901 – 1984), W. R. Burnett (1899 – 1982), and Ellery Queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the cozy style of the Golden Age mysteries in England, this American style of writing emphasized the raw edge of life. Violence was frequent and vivid. Sex played a key role, as did alcohol. The detectives were neck deep in the corruption of their day, from the mistrust of the police and authorities to the organized crime that grew out of the 1930s prohibition movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardboiled style grew in popularity as the public trust in the police and their ability to uphold the law or even follow it themselves diminished during the excesses of the Roaring ‘20’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar genre, one often confused with hardboiled, that rose during this era is the noir story. Taken from the French word for ‘black’, the term referenced the dark, harsh realities of life. But unlike a hardboiled mystery that centered around a private eye or other crime solver, the noir story focused on the average man or woman caught up in some dark situation. Often framed for murder, running for his life, the noir protagonist must evade the cops, the bad guys trying to kill or frame him and find the clues that will prove his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or not. A major convention of the noir plot was that the innocent do not always win. Justice does not always prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant contributors to the noir style include Hammett, as well as James M. Cain’s &lt;i&gt;The Postman Always Rings Twice&lt;/i&gt; (1934) and Horace McCoy’s &lt;i&gt;They Shoot Horses, Don’t They&lt;/i&gt; (1935)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://noirfiction.info/what2.htm&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both hardboiled and noir styles of mystery fiction dominated the American scene through the 1930s and into the beginnings of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-wwii-patriotism-amp-the-rise-of-competent-cops&quot;&gt;Post WWII Patriotism &amp;amp; the Rise of Competent Cops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War II saw a shift in the attitude of the American people towards authority figures and a similar shift in what the public wanted in their mystery fiction. As patriotism, in both America and Britain, grew out of the effects of the war, a new form of detective fiction took shape. Instead of featuring a loner private eye, it featured the intelligent, crafty and honest police detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the police detectives portrayed in mystery fiction up until this point in history were either comic relief or mere window dressing for the crafty private detective. Ranging from Conan Doyle’s Inspector Lestrade who frequently sought Sherlock Holmes’ help in anything but the simplest cases to the corrupt officials often portrayed in the pulp stories, police detectives were shown little respect by mystery writers, reflecting the public’s opinion of the authorities as less than helpful at best, corrupt and incompetent at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise in patriotism came a new found respect for government forces and authority, and along with it, the desire in the public and by the writers themselves to show the police detectives in a better light. Many of the stories centered around single police detectives like Inspector Morse of Colin Dextor’s (b. 1930) imagination to Ed McBain’s (1926 – 2005) Detective Steve Carella, featured in the &lt;i&gt;87th Precinct&lt;/i&gt; stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to stories centered on a single police detective, the police procedural story found root, featuring more than just detectives. The police procedural depicts the full cadre of police teams, from detectives to forensics teams. Popularized in much of the television programs starting in the 1950s and continuing to today, the police procedural turns the classic whodunit plot on its head by revealing the murderer right away; in fact, often showing the murder as it is being committed. The thrill for the reader is the chase by the police to apprehend and bring the criminal to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;television-movies-amp-the-continued-mystery-of-the-mystery&quot;&gt;Television, Movies &amp;amp; the Continued Mystery of the Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As television and film grew in popularity and more households had access to easy entertainment just a click of a button away, the mass popularity of magazines like “Black Mask” and “Detective Fiction Weekly”, among others began to die off. So, too, did the mass market paperback novel. They didn’t die completely, as demonstrated by the continued publication of “Ellery Queen” magazine and a few others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the World Wide Web, a few publications attempted to revitalize the pulp magazine style but few managed to find strong enough audiences to make a real go of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the love of the mystery still lives on, as strong as ever. According to book publishing statistics, mystery fiction constitutes between 25–28 percent of all fiction sold in the United States each year. The styles and subgenres haven’t changed and current authors regularly move between Golden Age and cozy styles to modern takes on the noir or hardboiled PI story. And even a casual look at any television listing shows many, if not most of the shows airing are some kind of mystery story, proof that the form is far from dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the earliest gossip between tribesmen on some prehistoric plain about a murder committed out of jealousy or greed through the various incarnations of detectives, both amateur and professional, from bumbling accidental discovery of clues to organized investigation of every facet of a mystery, the fascination with murder, crime, the dark side of life has never been far from the human psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the desire to tell a lurid story, of demonstrating our greater intellect over that of an author or literary detective or our friends, has brought people together for uncounted centuries. It may be gruesome, but it’s great entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;morgue-bait&quot;&gt;Morgue Bait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years Bay Street was the place. Bar whisky for eight cents a shot or a double slug for fifteen. Waterfront Street. The dirty grey waves slapped at the crusted piles and left an oil scum. A street to forget with. A street which could close in on you, day to day, night to night, until you maybe ran into an old friend who slipped you a five, and somebody saw you get it; there at dawn an interne from city hospital would shove your eyelid up with a clean, pink thumb. “Icebox meat,” he’d say. “Morgue bait.” And maybe, as he stood up, he’d look down at your hollow grey face and the sharp bones of your wrists and wonder how you’d kept alive so long. So very long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something happened to Bay Street. It acquired glamor. Reading the trend, the smart boys came down and bought up the property and built long low clubs with blue lights and bright music and expensive drinks. The shining cars lined up along the curb, and the people with the clean clothes gave ragged kids two bits to make certain the tires weren’t slashed while they were inside the places with the bright music and the soft women. The doormen at the new places had no time for the men in broken shoes who were living out the last years of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the men of Bay Street moved to Dorrity Street—one block over. Many of the displaced little bars moved over. The red, blue and green neon flickered against the brick flanks of the ancient warehouses, and, in the night, the steaming chant of the jukeboxes, the hoarse laughter and the scuff of broken shoes was the same as always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bard sat on the stone front step of an abandoned warehouse and stared at the street, shining in a light misty rain. The rain made pink halos around the neon of the place across the street. “Allison’s Grill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard thought vaguely that if the rain increased, he’d have to get under shelter. He didn’t want to go inside; he had come out because he had been sick. The muscles of his diaphragm still ached with the violence of his retching. He turned the ragged collar of his dark blue suit coat up around his neck. He wondered if he ought to walk down the alley and see if anybody had tried to move in on him. Two weeks before, he had found a sturdy packing case and, at dawn, had dragged it down the alley and put it under a fire escape. The effort had left him weak and panting. He had filled it with clean burlap and it made a snug bed. The fall rain was chill; the packing case wouldn’t be any good in the winter. He forced that thought out of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a dark man, with a sullen face. Once he had been solid, almost stocky, but the flesh had slowly melted off him during the past year. He was still capable of sudden, explosive bursts of energy. His hair was long and his square jaw was dark with several day’s beard. His cheeks were hollow and there was a dark wildness in his puffy eyes that the shadows concealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the street an old man with matted white hair lurched out of Allison’s and fell on one knee. He got up and went on, limping and cursing in a thin, high voice, watered down by age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bard heard the slow tock, tock of heels, heavy heels, coming down the sidewalk on his side. He knew who it was without looking. He scowled down at the sidewalk. The slow steps stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;i-like-it-this-way&quot;&gt;I Like It This Way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked up. Patrolman Clarence Flynn, tall and solid, stood looking down at him. Flynn’s raincoat had a cape effect across the shoulders that made him look larger than life size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said softly, “You okay, Frankie?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give me a cigarette, Flynn,” Bard said hoarsely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flynn handed him one, lit it. Over the match flame the two men glanced briefly into each other’s eyes—and looked quickly away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same gentle tone, Flynn said, “When are you going to straighten out, Frankie?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You were a good cop, Frankie. You straighten out and you could come back in; your record’s good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You look sick, Frankie.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m fine. You got a beat to walk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flynn shrugged. He handed the half pack of cigarettes to Bard and walked on. He stopped ten feet away and said, “She wasn’t worth this, Frankie; no woman was worth this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard called him a foul word and snapped the half smoked cigarette into the street. After he could no longer hear the sound of Flynn’s heels, he tried to light another one. His hands shook so badly that he couldn’t do it. The matches were damp. They sputtered and went out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He felt in his side pocket to make certain that the fifty-cent piece was still there. It was cool against his fingertips. He stood up, swaying slightly, and then walked across the street, pushed his way into the heat and smell of Allison’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bar was of plywood laid over some heavier substance. Naked bulbs were laid behind the bottles on the back bar, and the light glowed through—amber. The place was narrow and rectangular—with the bar on the left and booths on the right. A jukebox sat against the far wall, bubbles rising endlessly up through the colored tubes. Arther Allison, a small trim man with Truman glasses and a grey Colman mustache, in a spotless white shirt, waited on bar, his quick eyes flicking ceaselessly from face to face. Allison was a watchful, careful man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader waited on the booths and, on occasion, acted as bouncer. Jader was tall and heavy with weak eyes that watered constantly. He, too, was watchful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath the bar, to the left of the beer taps, was a small drawer. There were usually a few small packages in that drawer. Summer and winter a small hot coal fire burned in the basement. In the winter, the fire heated the building; in the summer the radiators were turned off. On the under edge of the drawer containing the packages was a small loop of wire. Either Jader or Allison could, by yanking on the loop of wire, drop the bottom of the drawer. The little packages would then drop down a chute into the fire. It was safer that way. For every package held and relayed to the proper pickup men, there was a small fee of ten dollars. Five for Jader and five for Allison. On some days as many as eight packages spent varying lengths of time in the drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison and Jader were very watchful and cautious men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Frank Bard walked in, there were four men at the bar. He knew three of them by sight; the fourth was a stranger. Two of the booths were occupied. In one were two Swedish merchant seamen, and a thin painted girl with hair the color of ripe tomatoes and a wet, smeared mouth. In the second booth were two quiet men wearing dark topcoats. Bard glanced at them and guessed that they were waiting for one of the packages to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard di	d a curious thing. He held the door wide, and, as he walked over to the bar, he smiled down over his right shoulder. He said something in a low voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stepped up beside the stranger, still smiling down at a point about six inches from his right shoulder. Allison moved over toward him and said, “You got the money, Frank?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took the fifty-cent piece from his pocket and said, “The usual for me and Jeanie, Arthur.” Allison poured two straight ryes and smiled tiredly as he put one in front of Bard and one in front of the empty space. Bard said, “You wouldn’t rather sit in a booth, would you, Jeanie?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell do you keep asking her that, for?” Arthur said. “She never wants to sit in a booth; she always stands up here at the bar with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard looked vaguely indignant. “It’s polite to ask her, Arthur.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stranger, a lean man in work clothes with a pinched, bitter mouth, looked with pained disgust at Frank Bard and then at Allison. “What the hell goes on?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison looked amused. “Oh, Frank comes in here all the time with Jeanie.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bard turned and looked at the stranger. “Jeanie and me, we like this place. She likes to come here even if 3he did have a little bad luck here a little over a year ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stranger looked into Bard’s eyes and moved back a few inches. “Bad luck?” he inquired politely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Jeanie was in here late one night and some lush hit her with a bottle. Hit her right over the left ear. I guess my Jeanie hasn’t got such a tough skull. Funny how it didn’t break the bottle, hey Arthur?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;jeanie&quot;&gt;Jeanie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader came over, his pale eyes watering. He said, “Damn it, Arthur, what did you let this dizzy punk come in here for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur grinned. “Nervous?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, the guy drives away trade.” He turned to the stranger. “Mister, a drunk bashed her head in with a bottle and got clean away. We give the cops a description but they never found the guy.” He paused and glanced at Bard, who was talking to Jeanie in a low voice, almost a whisper. He continued, “And this thing used to be a cop. Jeanie was his girl. He’s been on the skids for nearly a year, and every time he comes in here he’s got that damn imaginary woman with him. I tell you, it’s enough to drive me nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur grinned tightly. “Where’s your sense of humor, Jader?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader looked again at Bard, cursed and wandered off. The Swedes were pounding on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bard bent low over his glass of rye. He lifted it with a quick motion, and downed it. It caught in his throat. He gagged, but it stayed down. He stood for a moment, savoring the glow of it, feeling immediately stronger, more confident. He glanced at the wall above the back-bar, whistling softly. His lean hand, dirt stained into the knuckles, reached slowly out, shoving the empty glass over toward Jeanie. The hand hooked around her full glass and brought it back. He glanced down, as though surprised to see the full drink in front of him. He drank it with steadier hand and smiled at Jeanie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Taste good to you, honey? If I had the dough, I’d buy you another.” He looked down at his dime change. He glanced over and said, “What was that, honey?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He beckoned to Arthur. “Arthur, Jeanie says …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I know. She wants a beer chaser.” He picked up the dime, drew one beer and set it in front of Jeanie. Bard whistled again, while his right hand stole out and slid it over. He drank it quickly and, again looking at the wall, shoved the glass over in front of Jeanie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stranger said, “You were a cop?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard looked at him and drew himself up, looking for a fraction of a second, out of the wise, confident policeman’s eyes. The expression faded and his eyes once more looked hot and wild. “What’s it to you!” he demanded hoarsely. “I don’t see you buying me and Jeanie no drinks; buy ’em and we’ll talk to you, Mister.” The man took hold of Bard’s shoulder with what was almost gentleness. He turned him so that he faced him directly. The work-hardened hand came across, smacking solidly, fingers open, across Bard’s jaw, knocking him against the bar. The hand came back in a backhand blow that straightened him up again, splitting his underlip at the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bard stood unsteadily, his hands at his side, grinning foolishly at the stranger, his eyes filling with tears from the burning pain in his lip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur said, “Take it easy!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stranger said, “That’s for being a lousy cop; that’s for nothing. You there, set up drinks for Prince Charming and his lady.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thanks,” Bard said humbly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Think nothing of it, Prince.” The man turned his back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard drank the two drinks and stood holding onto the edge of the bar. His face greyed and he said, “Excuse me, honey.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lurched off to the men’s room and was ill. He came out in a few minutes, still shaking, his clothes soiled and stopped by the bar. He said, “Come on, Jeanie.” He walked toward the door. Jader crossed close beside him. With wild fury, Bard grabbed Jader’s arm and spun him around. He said, “Why the hell don’t you watch where you’re going?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He bent over suddenly, as though helping someone up from the floor. He snarled at Jader, “Okay. Okay. Go around knocking women down and don’t apologize. You all right, honey,” he said softly, making brushing motions in the air. Jader grunted, balled a large white fist and slowly drew, it back, his wet eyes narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur snapped, “Jader! Cut it!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big hand unclenched and Bard walked to the door, held it open with a small bow and then walked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader said, “Arthur, I’m not going to stand for …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shut up!” The grey eyes were cold behind the lenses, the mouth a thin tight line under the mustache. The girl with the Swedes giggled shrilly. Jader turned and walked toward the back of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the alley Frank Bard stood, his hand on the corner of the packing case, looking up at the night sky. The rain had stopped and small clouds scudded across the moon. Bard dropped to his knees and crawled into the box. He lay with his face against the damp wood and tears ran down through the thick stubble on his cheeks. He reached awkwardly into his side pocket and pulled out a small package. He unwrapped the paper. It contained a small cool metal tube that still contained lipstick. Her lipstick. He held it close to his nose. It held the elusive scent of her. His fingertips touched the little skein of hair. Her hair. Long and pale and delicate—amazingly golden. He wrapped the package and replaced it in his pocket. After a long time, he slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-4&quot;&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-back-booth&quot;&gt;The Back Booth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader was in a good mood. The drawer was almost full of packages and the first pickup was due in an hour. Arthur Allison had gone to the races. It was the first time Jader had been alone in the place in many months. He liked the feeling of being trusted. The sun was hot on Dorrity Street. It slanted through the smeared front window, lighting the dim interior. One old man was asleep, his head on the booth table. Jader planned to wake him up and get him out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He glanced across the street and his cheerful smile faded. He saw Frank Bard coming diagonally across the street in the sun, looking down at a spot six inches from his right shoulder. Jader could see his lips moving. Jader’s lip curled as he saw Bard’s grey, shapeless shoes, the tired scuff of his walk, the stained, baggy trousers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stepped over into the doorway as Bard opened the door. Jader didn’t move. Bard said, “Hey! Let us in!” He took a dollar out of his side pocket and held it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want no screwballs in here,” Jader said sullenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’s Arthur? Arthur lets us come in. Get out of Jeanie’s way, Jader.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re not coming in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard stared at him for a few seconds. “Arthur won’t like to hear about this. You got a public place here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You stand up to the bar and talk to the other customers. The hell with that noise; you drive away business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bard considered that statement solemnly. “Okay. So Jeanie and me, we’ll take the back booth in the end and we won’t talk to anybody, will we Jeanie?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader glanced down the street, saw a familiar sedan coming. It would be best not to delay pickup. He moved aside. “Okay, come on in and take the end booth. I’ll be with you in a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard stood aside as though to let someone come in, and then followed. Jader waited until Bard was out of sight in the booth before slipping the package across to the slim, dark man who had ordered the beer. The man drank up and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader poured two ryes and walked back to the booth with them. Frank Bard smiled up at him. “No, she’s sitting right there across from me, Jader. Maybe we should take a booth oftener. It’s nice and private back here in the end. Jeanie says it’s nice and clean. Clean ashtray and everything. She don’t mind being in the booth where she got hit. Do you, Jeanie?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader scowled. “‘The place is good and clean because I clean it. Stop the chatter and give me the buck; there’s a dime extra for table service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But you made me come back here!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dime extra.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Jader. Okay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader rang up the half dollar and took the change back. He threw it on the table. Bard said, “The front way is the only way out, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” he answered and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went behind the bar and stood with his fat arms on the bar, looking gloomily across at the old man sleeping. Some of the flavor had gone out of the day with Frank Bard’s arrival. He seldom showed up in the afternoon. It was just damn bad luck that he had to pick that afternoon, Jader thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He scowled as he heard the low sound of Bard’s voice. Jader couldn’t imagine why Arthur permitted Bard to come around, in fact, why he seemed amused to have Bard around. It was the type of wry joke that Jader couldn’t savor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he heard Bard call him hoarsely, he pushed away from the bar, drew two more ryes and walked slowly back to the booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stood in front of the booth and reached out to set one rye down across from Bard. The big white hand stopped in midair and Jader stared at the ashtray. There were two butts in the ashtray. The tip of one was crimsoned with lipstick. For a moment he thought wildly that he hadn’t cleaned it. And he suddenly remembered Bard’s saying it was clean. The shot glass slipped out of his white fingers and dropped, overturning on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’d that come from?” he said in a high, thin voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cigarette butt? Jeanie smoked it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t say that!” Jader said wildly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you like women smoking? That’s old fashioned,” Bard said severely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’d it come from?” Jader demanded again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I told you, from Jeanie.” Bard suddenly leaned his dark head over and looked at his shoulder. He chuckled mildly. “She was sitting right beside me here with her head on my shoulder when she smoked it. Look here.” From the surface of the dark blue coat he plucked two long strands of shining gold—held them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader’s mouth worked and the other glass dropped at his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard said, “You see, Jader, you only thought you killed her.” His tone was quiet, as though explaining to a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jader made a strangled noise. His wet eyes widened. “I killed her. She couldn’t … . She couldn’t … .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-5&quot;&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;jader&quot;&gt;Jader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned then and looked into Frank Bard’s eyes. His underlip hung away from his teeth and he took a slow step away from the booth. Somehow Bard was in front of him. Jader clenched his white fists and struck blindly. He missed and went off balance as Frank Bard’s thin, dirty fist smashed his mouth. He fell heavily to his hands and knees, going over onto his side as one of the grey, broken shoes landed against the side of his head. One of the white hands lay, as still as lard, against the floor. Frank Bard set his heel on the fingers and swiveled his entire weight, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked quickly to the front door and locked it. The old mas still slept. He went behind the bar and carefully opened the drawer. Allison and Jader were cautious, watchful men—but who suspicions or fears a mad alcoholic? He set six neat packages on the top of the bar, opened the cash register and took a nickel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sergeant Sullivan, Police Headquarters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sully, this is Frank Bard … don’t interrupt me … I’m at Allison’s Grill on Dorrity Street. I’ve just taken over the joint. Jader confessed to killing Jean Palmray. The angle is that she was trying to do some independent spying to help me along and they got wise and Jader killed her; I think he only meant to stun her. I’ve got a bunch of junk here. Six small packages. Send the boys. And have Arthur Allison picked up out at the track. Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hung up, walked back and looked at Jader. The man was beginning to stir. Bard kicked him in the head again and walked back to the bar. He was suddenly enormously tired. He still held the small golden tube of lipstick in his fist. He slipped it into his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wouldn’t take a lush back on the force, even if he had done what he set out to do one year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took a bottle off the back bar and pulled the patent gimmick out of the top of it and tilted it up to his lips. Drunk or sober, he had remembered to pretend that Jeanie had been with him. That was what had counted. The buildup. And after a year of buildup, Jader had cracked wide open. It had been tough, pretending that she was always beside him, looking at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tilted the bottle, and as the sharp liquor filled his mouth, he felt a soft touch on his arm. He spun quickly, spraying the liquor onto the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old man was still asleep in the booth and Jader was still silent on the floor. The door was locked. In the distance an approaching siren moaned softly. The bottle slid from his nerveless fingers and shattered on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;right-under-your-stupid-noses&quot;&gt;Right Under Your Stupid Noses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Sergeant Forbes made a gesture of exasperated frustration with his big hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tell you, Mr. Carter, Donovan or Greene or I have had Louie under our eye every minute of the day since you first put us on the case,” he protested to the district attorney; “and at night one or the other of us has camped outside the door of his hotel room and peeked through the keyhole. If he’d contacted Landis, we’d have seen them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s right, Mr. Carter,” Detective Donovan affirmed earnestly. “That guy hasn’t even been to the men’s room without one of us tag-gin’ along; he just couldn’t have met Landis without us knowin’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He just couldn’t have, but he just has,” District Attorney Jeff Carter amended with deadly calm. “Or maybe you two think he pulls those phony tens and twenties out of his hat, the way a magician does rabbits. Louie and Landis are meeting somewhere, and meeting regularly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His voice rose to a sudden roar. “What’s more, they’re doing it right under your stupid noses. Now get back on the job, and this time try tailing Louie with your eyes open; you can tell Greene the same goes for him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two detectives muttered hasty “Yes, sirs,” and departed from the district attorney’s office with an air of injured dignity which implied that they considered themselves unjustly impugned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the office door had closed behind them, Jeff spoke to his younger brother Stephen, who had been slouched sideways with his feet dangling over the arm of the visitor’s chair while he waited for the district attorney to be ready to go out to lunch. “I’ve never known Greene or Donovan —let alone Forbes—to fall down on a simple assignment of this kind before,” he remarked; “yet the facts prove they’ve slipped somewhere. But I’m hanged if I can figure out where.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen pivoted about on the end of his spine until his feet came to rest upon the floor in front of him. “Just who are these chaps, Louie and Landis, Jeff?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Counterfeiters,” the district attorney answered. “Lonesome Louie Madden pushes the stuff— gets it into circulation—and isn’t especially important. But Big Ben Landis is the brains of the gang; that’s why I want to use Louie to lead us to him. Naturally, the Federal men are working on the case, too; but they’re leaving this particular angle of it for my office to handle, and I’d like to show them we can make good. Only for some reason that’s a complete mystery to me, the best men on my staff seem unable to follow a trail that must be as broad as the back end of a Mack truck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe Landis is passing the money along to Louie through some other member of the gang,” Stephen suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff shook his head. “Landis doesn’t operate that way,” he replied. “He claims that the middle man is the weakest point in a counterfeiting ring—which is pretty much the truth—so he doesn’t use one. He manufactures the stuff himself, from engraving the plates down to the actual printing, and doles it out to two or three legmen, who pass it on small purchases, and turn what they get in change back to him—less their commissions, of course. He never gives any of them more than a few hundred dollars at a time, for fear they may get ideas about skipping out and going into temporary business for themselves. That’s how I know he must be contacting Louie practically every other day or so. The thing that’s got me beat is, how does he do it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Could be he’s leaving the stuff somewhere for Louie to pick up,” Stephen offered. “Say a box in the railroad station, for instance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m afraid that’s out, too,” the district attorney said. “I’ve got the daily reports hare from Forbes, Donovan, and Greene ever since they’ve been on the case.” he gestured toward a manila folder of papers on the desk in front of biro, “and not one of them so much as mentions Louie’s having gone anywhere near a railroad station or any other place where he could pick up a package that might contain two or three hundred dollars in phony tens and twenties. All he does when he goes out is stroll about the center of town for an hour or so and make a few small purchases with his phony money. I can’t let it go on much longer; yet if I pick him up now, I’ll lose the only chance I may get to catch Landis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Landis is wearing a disguise when they meet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff smiled briefly, also ironically. “It would be easier to disguise a hippopotamus than Big Ben Landis,” be observed. “The man must ‘weigh over three hundred pounds. But let’s forget about him while we have lunch.” He reached for his own hat on the clothes tree in the corner, then tossed Stephen his. “I don’t want my appetite spoiled.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen caught the hat with one hand and placed it at a rakish angle upon his dark head. With the other hand, he picked up the folder of reports from his brother’s desk, and took it with him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;a-little-friendly-call-on-louie&quot;&gt;A Little, Friendly Call On Louie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the afternoon, having a free hour or so, Stephen went over the reports carefully in the privacy of his own law office. He learned from them two things that he considered significant. The first was that every morning at exactly ten-thirty, Lonesome Louie left the cheap hotel where he was staying to go for a walk, during which he merely strolled aimlessly about for an hour or so, then returned to the hotel; the second was that he repeated this procedure every afternoon at exactly one-thirty. Stephen smiled with satisfaction at the reports. They had told him precisely what he wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening during dinner, he brought up the subject of Lonesome Louie and Big Ben Landis. “What would you say, Jeff,” he began, “to my going along with Sergeant Forbes tomorrow morning when he goes on duty?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district attorney looked up suspiciously from his plate. “What for?” he demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think I know how we can make Lonesome Louie lead us to Big Ben Landis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff snorted skeptically. “This isn’t a problem in deduction, Steve,” he pointed out. “It’s a matter of routine tailing that doesn’t call for any fancy mental gymnastics, but just for ordinary police training and practice; which Forbes has had, and you haven’t. If he hasn’t been able to spot the way Louie makes contact with Landis, how can you expect to do it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Still, I don’t guess it’d do any harm if I tried,” Stephen persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff was forced to concede the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning Lonesome Louie was temporarily disconcerted upon descending from the unclean flea-bag that was his room, to find two tailers instead of the usual one waiting for him in the lobby of the hotel—especially when he recognized in the smaller of the two the younger brother of the district attorney. But his generally lugubrious countenance relaxed in a confident grin when, as he sallied forth, both Stephen and the big sergeant fell into step behind him in the usual way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see, Mr. Stephen,” Forbes said, discouraged, after they had played a kind of shadow tag with Louie for the better part of an hour, “he doesn’t meet anybody or do anything worth battin’ an eye at. He acts more like a man who’s just out to kill time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen smiled in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Forbes, how right you are!” he murmured, but he didn’t sound in the least discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louie continued to lead them a merry, if somewhat leisurely, chase for another half hour, then he headed back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, instead of taking up their former position on the scuffed leather bench in the lobby facing the staircase and the perpetually out-of-order elevator, Stephen waited until the man they were tailing had disappeared from sight up the stairs; then he began to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll just pay a little, friendly call on Louie,” he remarked to the sergeant. “I’ve a notion this is his time to be receiving company, although I don’t guess he’ll be expecting us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they unceremoniously flung open the door to Louie’s room, the enormous fat man who was there with Louie sprang up with a violence that sent his chair crashing over backwards. His hand made a quick jab toward his hip pocket, but stopped midway when he saw the muzzle of Sergeant Forbe’s police automatic trained upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Landis,” the sergeant said with grim satisfaction, “you can reach, but it’s not gonna be for anything you can touch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-mountain&quot;&gt;The Mountain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the district attorney’s office an hour or so later, Stephen lolled in the visitor’s chair and cocked one leg indolently over its arm. “It was all perfectly simple, Jeff,” he drawled. “I spotted it as soon as I read those reports, and noticed that Louie went for a walk every day at exactly the same time in the morning, and again in the afternoon. After he’d left the hotel —with Forbes or Donovan or Greene, as the case might be, following—Landis simply walked in and waited in his room for him to come back, when he gave Louie a fresh supply of the counterfeit money and collected his share of the real money Louie had got in change when he passed the phony bills. Then, when Louie went out for his afternoon walk, Landis left again. It was all perfectly safe and, as I said before, perfectly simple; so simple that I’d have spotted it even without reading the reports.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That,” Jeff stated flatly; “I don’t believe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen smiled with the bland ingenuousness that always set his older brother’s teeth on edge. “But it’s true, Jeff,” he protested. “If Louie wasn’t meeting Landis—and it was plain that he wasn’t, or Forbes or one of the other men you had tailing him would have spotted them—then the only other way for them to make contact was for Landis to meet him. You all made the quite natural mistake of expecting Mohammed to go to the mountain, whereas,” his smile became even more ingenuous, “this was one of the rare instances in which the mountain came to Mohammed.”&lt;/p&gt;
