  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the construction of our story we must consider the question of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;length&quot;&gt;Length&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and in the opinion of many authorities best, there is the short-story. With exceptions, the best mystery stories are short-stories. A short-story lends itself peculiarly to a mystery plot, principally because it is not easy to keep wonder and curiosity alive through a long story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, many detective stories fall naturally into the length of a novelette—say 30,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a two-or three-part story, which differs from the novelette in construction, even when of the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form is the serial, in which each installment must have its own climax, all leading to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last of all, there is the full-sized book, where the interest may or may not be broken before the denouement and solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-short-story-and-the-novel&quot;&gt;The Short-Story and the Novel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of making many books concerning and dissecting the short-story there is no end. As many probably there are regarding the construction of the novel; and between these two forms they tell us there is a great gulf fixed. But the fixing of this gulf is largely a matter of opinion, and the opinions are somewhat diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One writer explains the intrinsic difference between a short-story and a story that is merely short. He holds that a short-story is by no means a condensed novel, but is different in kind from a novel. The novelette, however, he contends is a brief novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writer, following this distinction, goes so far as to say that were the novelette condensed to one half or less of its usually accepted length it would still be a novel and not a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, were a short-story expanded indefinitely it could never become a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of this distinction lies in the principle that a short-story is founded on a unity of impression. It relates, more or less definitely, a single episode; while a novel is a series of correlated episodes, bearing on a single motive. The number of words in a piece of fiction has absolutely no part in determining its nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's distinction that a novel cannot be read at a sitting and a short-story can, is not entirely valid. For &quot;a sitting&quot; is surely a most uncertain division of time. To the busy man a sitting may be a half an hour; to the idle woman it may be half a day; while to the &quot;shut-in&quot; it is continuous and interminable. Moreover, in the case of a thrilling Mystery Story, a reader's sitting would be prolonged, even in spite of imperative duty calls, because of the desire to reach the solution of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as a distinction, we are told that the novel is expansive and the short-story intensive. Perhaps an illustration might be made by likening the novel to a map of the United States, and the short-story to a single state on the map viewed under a magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these differentiations regarding short-stories and novels are fully explained and discussed in books exclusively devoted to such technique. And though the fine distinctions therein drawn are of highest importance to other branches of fiction, they are almost, if not entirely, negligible in the case of Detective Stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the inherent difference between a novel and a short-story is one of plot. Whereas, since Detective Stories have but one solitary plot,—&quot;the problem and its solution,&quot;—the difference in the detective short-story or the detective novel is merely that of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;singleness-of-plot-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;Singleness of Plot in the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single plot that makes a Detective Story may be likened to an accordion; it may be pulled out to an extraordinary length, or compressed to a minimum. A detective novel may have minor complications, more characterization and more elaborate setting; but the plot must not vary from the plot of a detective short-story, being only the propounding of the riddle and the revealing of its answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer the story the more numerous and bewildering the conditions of the riddle and the windings of the maze, but all tend definitely to the one end — the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short-story the plot rushes on breathlessly, bare and straight to its end. In a novelette, there is more room for side-lights, more time for slower development, and more scope for minor issues; while a full-sized book still further amplifies these possibilities. But in these three forms the main thread must go on, without halt, in an ever rising crescendo of interest to the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the work is to be published in two or three parts, or if it is a longer serial, then the plan is so far changed as to present a definite climax at the end of each installment. But these must be all minor climaxes and all bearing successively and cumulatively on the final revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-length-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Question of Length of the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in writing detective fiction, unlike other kinds, the length of his story is entirely at the option of the author. For the detective plot possesses the characteristics of a piece of string; it differs from its fellows only in length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; could have been told in a hundred pages, but Wilkie Collins gives it five hundred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; could have been a full-sized book as well as &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; The inquest scene in the latter fills seventy pages, while Poe's story details the inquest in six pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's stories are short because he uses the single incident of the crime and the single impression of its solution, with an absence of any detail not absolutely necessary. Sherlock Holmes himself, who is often a medium for his author's views, says that he could do in twenty-four hours detective work on which Lecoq occupied six months. This is true enough, but the reason is that, as we have previously pointed out, Lecoq figured in a novel while Sherlock had to do his work expeditiously in the confines of a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau chose to write novels, and so in connection with the problem and its solution he makes use of side issues of all sorts; even including the past history of his characters, subordinate plots, and various byways of conjecture or misleadings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see the length of a Mystery Story is entirely at the pleasure of the performer, without the hampering rules laid down for the writers of ether types of fiction. Say the plot depends upon a cypher interest. Conan Doyle did the story of the &quot;Dancing Men&quot; in a short-story; Poe's &quot;Gold Bug&quot; is a novelette; while James DeMille's &quot;The Cryptogram&quot; is a very long book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be because Detective Stories are the work of artisans rather than artists that they can be fitted to such a Procrustean bed of literature. But though a sponge may be the size of your head or compressed to the size of your fist, it is the same sponge and comprises and includes the same material and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this general principle must be taken with limitations. Some of Conan Doyle's short-stories could not be made into satisfactory books, while others could easily be. As in other fiction, a slight incident is not enough for a novel, but a great incident is. A missing Christmas goose might not be of sufficient interest to fill a book, when a murder mystery is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we may say a simple mystery indicates a short-story length, while a complex riddle, or one made complex by side issues means a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it is here that art steps in. A master hand can make a great interest out of a simple mystery, where a tyro could not succeed. Generally speaking, the short-story must differ from the novel in scope and structure. In detective fiction it differs in scope only; for the main structure is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers of the technique of fiction tell us that another difference between the short-story and the novel lies in the fact that the novel must be a love story, while the short-story need not deal with romance at all. Applied to detective fiction, this may be adapted to mean that a love interest is possible, though not imperative in a novel or a novelette; but a short-story has no reason for romance and no room for it, unless it is a necessary premise to the conditions of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of absolute measurement, perhaps we may call four thousand words an ideal length for a short-story. A novelette should be thirty or thirty-five thousand words long; while a book may run as near as you wish to one hundred thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of Poe's &quot;Gold Bug,&quot; nearly fifteen thousand words, would not be an acceptable size to editors of the present day. And though great writers may be a law unto themselves in this matter, it is wise to arrange a story in accordance with the editors' preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houdini, the magician, in speaking of his own principles of legerdemain, said: &quot;It is more difficult to support admiration than to excite it,&quot; and so it is more difficult to hold an intellectual curiosity than to arouse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his introduction to an excellent collection of mystery stories, Mr. Julian Hawthorne has written so discerningly on this subject that we quote from his article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I need hardly point out that there is a distinction and a difference between short riddle stories and long ones—novels. The former require far more technical art for their proper development; the enigma cannot be posed in so many ways, but must be stated once for all; there cannot be false scents, or but a few of them; there can be small opportunity for character drawing, and all kinds of ornament and comment must be reduced to their very lowest terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here, indeed, as everywhere, genius will have its way; and while a merely talented writer would deem it impossible to tell the story of ‘The Gold Bug’ in less than a volume, Poe could do it in a few thousand words, and yet appear to have said everything worth saying. In the case of the Sherlock Holmes tales, they form a series, and our previous knowledge of the hero enables the writer to dispense with much description and accompaniment that would be necessary had that eminent personage been presented in only a single complication of events. Each special episode of the great analyst's career can therefore be handled with the utmost economy, and yet fill all the requirements of intelligent interest and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But, as a rule, the riddle novel approaches its theme in a spirit essentially other than that which inspires the short tale. We are given, as it were, a wide landscape instead of a detailed genre picture. The number of the dramatis personae is much larger, and the parts given to many of them may be very small, though each should have his or her necessary function in the general plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is much easier to create perplexity on these terms; but on the other hand, the riddle novel demands a power of vivid character portrayal and of telling description which are not indispensable in the briefer narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fault of all riddle novels is that they inevitably involve two kinds of interest, and can seldom balance these so perfectly that one or the other of them shall not suffer. The mind of the reader becomes weary in its frequent journeys between human characters on one side and the mysterious events on the other, and would prefer the more single-eyed treatment of the short tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wonder too is a very tender and short-lived emotion, and sometimes perishes after a few pages. Curiosity is tougher; but that, too, may be baffled too long, and end by tiring of the pursuit while it is yet in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many excellent plots, admirable from the constructive point of view, have been wasted by stringing them out too far; the reader recognizes their merit, but loses his enthusiasm on account of a sort of monotony of strain; he wickedly turns to the concluding chapter, and the game is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'The Woman in White,' by Wilkie Collins, was published about 1860, I think, in weekly installments, and certainly they were devoured with insatiable appetite by many thousands of readers. But I doubt whether a book of similar merit could command such a following today; and I will even confess that I have myself never read the concluding parts, and do not know to this day who the woman was or what were the wrongs from which she so poignantly suffered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories which ought to be shorter are sometimes made into novels by long and often tedious interpolations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; one of Conan Doyle's best stories, is unduly spun out by an interpolation which lasts from page 110 to 184. Likewise Gaboriau's &quot;The Mystery of Orcival&quot; has an interpolation from page 104 to 188. These extraneous narratives usually go back and tell of an episode that happened years before the scene of the story, and they are both uninteresting and inartistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, an author of detective fiction writes either short- stories or novels, but rarely both. Conan Doyle's only mystery novel is &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles;&quot; while Gaboriau and Anna Katharine Green invariably write novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we conclude that length is a matter of taste, and the detective fiction writer may use his own judgment as to the length of his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-narrator-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Narrator in the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teller of the Detective Story is an important factor in its technique. Many a good plot is spoiled because it is narrated by the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, with his quick sense of fitness, chose the narrator best calculated for the exploitation of his clever Dupin. This was a stroke of real genius, for the reader becomes acquainted with the principal through the subordinate. He is taught to look upon the work of a detective intelligently; taught to appreciate and understand it. He knows when it is time to applaud, because the narrator tells him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pity that this narrator is nameless, for as Mrs. Harris, with even less personality, is a household word, so his name would have been. It is this narrator who rouses our interest, tantalizes our impatience, and piques our curiosity, in harmony with his own halting almost unbelieving observance of the marvels revealed to him. He teaches us to be amazed at the proper time and then at the proper time he explains what so amazed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Watson, narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, is a parallel character, though in no sense an imitation or plagiarism. The conditions of the revelations to be made require just such a person to make them; and without a doubt, Sherlock Holmes would have had his Dr. Watson even if Dupin had never had his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the glory and honor cast upon the hero by this humble but adoring satellite, this means of narration has another decided advantage. Since the detective confides in his friend or not, as he chooses, the author can reveal or conceal facts as he chooses, and so mislead the reader at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the subordinate does not know he can not tell, and thus is the secret preserved. Again, the subordinate being but fallible, may surmise mistakenly. So then does the reader, and again the author's ends are served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the author prefers that the tale be told in the third person, but even so, the character of &quot;Harris&quot; is still usually in evidence. Often he is a reporter, for this gives him opportunity to go uninvited, yet free from the stigma of idle curiosity into the scenes of interest. A reporter eager for a &quot;scoop&quot; for his paper, sets a fine example of alert interest and close scrutiny for the reader to profit by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the foreword to &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; the hero detective picks out his reporter and tells him how useful he will be to him in his work. &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; has the reporter &quot;Hutchinson Hatch,&quot; while &quot;Rouletabille&quot; has a clever reporter named &quot;Sainclair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the story may be told directly from the mouth of the author. But the proportion of this manner of telling is not so large in Detective Story work as in other fiction; because there are secrets to be preserved. Not only the main secret of the mystery, but also the secrets of what the strange proceedings of the detective may mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the author is telling the tale, it is manifestly difficult for him to preserve an ingenuous and veracious manner, though this may be done if the author maintains a certain aloofness and an arbitrary standard of what to tell and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau's stories are all told in the third person; so are DuBoisgobey's and many of Anna Katharine Green's. Gaston Leroux uses this form and so does Mr. Webster in &quot;The Whispering Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a conglomeration of forms. The narrator is changed to suit the needs of the author, and the book is made up of the stories of the diaries of several people interested; &quot;The Woman in White&quot; follows the same narrative method. &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; is also told by various people, and sometimes in diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not always effective in other fiction, the diary is a most useful form for Detective Stories. For secrets can be confided to a diary, and though thus revealed to the reader, they are not disclosed to the other characters in the book; which is frequently a necessary condition. While never used for the whole book, the diary form often appears on certain pages of the story. &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; and many of our best authors' works show more or less of the useful and often necessary diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever narrator is chosen, let the choice be made after careful consideration of the conditions of the story. If there is a great surprise which must be concealed until the end, the narrator must be kept in ignorance of it until the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the story hinges on the marvelous brain work of a transcendent detective, give him a Dr. Watson to expatiate on it and to be awed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a scientific or other straightforward recital of procedure, it may be told by the author. These points can best be learned and understood by reading the works of the best authors and noting what kind of narrator they choose and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-setting&quot;&gt;The Setting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting of the story will of course depend on the plot; but, other things being equal, do not choose too low life for your scenes. The facts of a murder are in themselves sufficiently unattractive to make it unnecessary to add to the distastefulness of the story by unpleasant surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the people in your story be at least fairly well to do, of at least moderately good position and of a decent education. Unless absolutely necessary to have it otherwise, let the house or the scene of the crime be attractive or interesting, and let even the subordinate characters be of refined and intelligent type. For one reader who enjoys tales of slum life there are a dozen who prefer ladies and gentlemen, if not lords and ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be argued that murders or other crimes do not occur in high life as frequently as among the lower classes. This point may be open to discussion; but it would make no difference what the decision might be. Detective Stories are not realistic, and if the author choose to have his murder committed in a community of gentle-folk, he is entirely at liberty to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the locality and social customs of the story must be those with which the author is familiar. A Detective Story depends so much on the logic and plausibility of its conditions, that a vague or uncertain touch on the practical or material details greatly mars the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see to it, then, that our setting and our atmosphere are free from mistake or anachronism. Economy of attention demands that we keep the reader's mind wholly intent on the solution of the problem; and this may not be done if we allow questionable or contradictory work on the minor interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the construction of our story we must consider the question of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;length&quot;&gt;Length&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and in the opinion of many authorities best, there is the short-story. With exceptions, the best mystery stories are short-stories. A short-story lends itself peculiarly to a mystery plot, principally because it is not easy to keep wonder and curiosity alive through a long story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, many detective stories fall naturally into the length of a novelette—say 30,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a two-or three-part story, which differs from the novelette in construction, even when of the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form is the serial, in which each installment must have its own climax, all leading to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last of all, there is the full-sized book, where the interest may or may not be broken before the denouement and solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-short-story-and-the-novel&quot;&gt;The Short-Story and the Novel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of making many books concerning and dissecting the short-story there is no end. As many probably there are regarding the construction of the novel; and between these two forms they tell us there is a great gulf fixed. But the fixing of this gulf is largely a matter of opinion, and the opinions are somewhat diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One writer explains the intrinsic difference between a short-story and a story that is merely short. He holds that a short-story is by no means a condensed novel, but is different in kind from a novel. The novelette, however, he contends is a brief novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writer, following this distinction, goes so far as to say that were the novelette condensed to one half or less of its usually accepted length it would still be a novel and not a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, were a short-story expanded indefinitely it could never become a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of this distinction lies in the principle that a short-story is founded on a unity of impression. It relates, more or less definitely, a single episode; while a novel is a series of correlated episodes, bearing on a single motive. The number of words in a piece of fiction has absolutely no part in determining its nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's distinction that a novel cannot be read at a sitting and a short-story can, is not entirely valid. For &quot;a sitting&quot; is surely a most uncertain division of time. To the busy man a sitting may be a half an hour; to the idle woman it may be half a day; while to the &quot;shut-in&quot; it is continuous and interminable. Moreover, in the case of a thrilling Mystery Story, a reader's sitting would be prolonged, even in spite of imperative duty calls, because of the desire to reach the solution of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as a distinction, we are told that the novel is expansive and the short-story intensive. Perhaps an illustration might be made by likening the novel to a map of the United States, and the short-story to a single state on the map viewed under a magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these differentiations regarding short-stories and novels are fully explained and discussed in books exclusively devoted to such technique. And though the fine distinctions therein drawn are of highest importance to other branches of fiction, they are almost, if not entirely, negligible in the case of Detective Stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the inherent difference between a novel and a short-story is one of plot. Whereas, since Detective Stories have but one solitary plot,—&quot;the problem and its solution,&quot;—the difference in the detective short-story or the detective novel is merely that of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;singleness-of-plot-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;Singleness of Plot in the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single plot that makes a Detective Story may be likened to an accordion; it may be pulled out to an extraordinary length, or compressed to a minimum. A detective novel may have minor complications, more characterization and more elaborate setting; but the plot must not vary from the plot of a detective short-story, being only the propounding of the riddle and the revealing of its answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer the story the more numerous and bewildering the conditions of the riddle and the windings of the maze, but all tend definitely to the one end — the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short-story the plot rushes on breathlessly, bare and straight to its end. In a novelette, there is more room for side-lights, more time for slower development, and more scope for minor issues; while a full-sized book still further amplifies these possibilities. But in these three forms the main thread must go on, without halt, in an ever rising crescendo of interest to the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the work is to be published in two or three parts, or if it is a longer serial, then the plan is so far changed as to present a definite climax at the end of each installment. But these must be all minor climaxes and all bearing successively and cumulatively on the final revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-length-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Question of Length of the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in writing detective fiction, unlike other kinds, the length of his story is entirely at the option of the author. For the detective plot possesses the characteristics of a piece of string; it differs from its fellows only in length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; could have been told in a hundred pages, but Wilkie Collins gives it five hundred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; could have been a full-sized book as well as &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; The inquest scene in the latter fills seventy pages, while Poe's story details the inquest in six pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's stories are short because he uses the single incident of the crime and the single impression of its solution, with an absence of any detail not absolutely necessary. Sherlock Holmes himself, who is often a medium for his author's views, says that he could do in twenty-four hours detective work on which Lecoq occupied six months. This is true enough, but the reason is that, as we have previously pointed out, Lecoq figured in a novel while Sherlock had to do his work expeditiously in the confines of a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau chose to write novels, and so in connection with the problem and its solution he makes use of side issues of all sorts; even including the past history of his characters, subordinate plots, and various byways of conjecture or misleadings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see the length of a Mystery Story is entirely at the pleasure of the performer, without the hampering rules laid down for the writers of ether types of fiction. Say the plot depends upon a cypher interest. Conan Doyle did the story of the &quot;Dancing Men&quot; in a short-story; Poe's &quot;Gold Bug&quot; is a novelette; while James DeMille's &quot;The Cryptogram&quot; is a very long book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be because Detective Stories are the work of artisans rather than artists that they can be fitted to such a Procrustean bed of literature. But though a sponge may be the size of your head or compressed to the size of your fist, it is the same sponge and comprises and includes the same material and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this general principle must be taken with limitations. Some of Conan Doyle's short-stories could not be made into satisfactory books, while others could easily be. As in other fiction, a slight incident is not enough for a novel, but a great incident is. A missing Christmas goose might not be of sufficient interest to fill a book, when a murder mystery is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we may say a simple mystery indicates a short-story length, while a complex riddle, or one made complex by side issues means a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it is here that art steps in. A master hand can make a great interest out of a simple mystery, where a tyro could not succeed. Generally speaking, the short-story must differ from the novel in scope and structure. In detective fiction it differs in scope only; for the main structure is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers of the technique of fiction tell us that another difference between the short-story and the novel lies in the fact that the novel must be a love story, while the short-story need not deal with romance at all. Applied to detective fiction, this may be adapted to mean that a love interest is possible, though not imperative in a novel or a novelette; but a short-story has no reason for romance and no room for it, unless it is a necessary premise to the conditions of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of absolute measurement, perhaps we may call four thousand words an ideal length for a short-story. A novelette should be thirty or thirty-five thousand words long; while a book may run as near as you wish to one hundred thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of Poe's &quot;Gold Bug,&quot; nearly fifteen thousand words, would not be an acceptable size to editors of the present day. And though great writers may be a law unto themselves in this matter, it is wise to arrange a story in accordance with the editors' preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houdini, the magician, in speaking of his own principles of legerdemain, said: &quot;It is more difficult to support admiration than to excite it,&quot; and so it is more difficult to hold an intellectual curiosity than to arouse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his introduction to an excellent collection of mystery stories, Mr. Julian Hawthorne has written so discerningly on this subject that we quote from his article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I need hardly point out that there is a distinction and a difference between short riddle stories and long ones—novels. The former require far more technical art for their proper development; the enigma cannot be posed in so many ways, but must be stated once for all; there cannot be false scents, or but a few of them; there can be small opportunity for character drawing, and all kinds of ornament and comment must be reduced to their very lowest terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here, indeed, as everywhere, genius will have its way; and while a merely talented writer would deem it impossible to tell the story of ‘The Gold Bug’ in less than a volume, Poe could do it in a few thousand words, and yet appear to have said everything worth saying. In the case of the Sherlock Holmes tales, they form a series, and our previous knowledge of the hero enables the writer to dispense with much description and accompaniment that would be necessary had that eminent personage been presented in only a single complication of events. Each special episode of the great analyst's career can therefore be handled with the utmost economy, and yet fill all the requirements of intelligent interest and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But, as a rule, the riddle novel approaches its theme in a spirit essentially other than that which inspires the short tale. We are given, as it were, a wide landscape instead of a detailed genre picture. The number of the dramatis personae is much larger, and the parts given to many of them may be very small, though each should have his or her necessary function in the general plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is much easier to create perplexity on these terms; but on the other hand, the riddle novel demands a power of vivid character portrayal and of telling description which are not indispensable in the briefer narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fault of all riddle novels is that they inevitably involve two kinds of interest, and can seldom balance these so perfectly that one or the other of them shall not suffer. The mind of the reader becomes weary in its frequent journeys between human characters on one side and the mysterious events on the other, and would prefer the more single-eyed treatment of the short tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wonder too is a very tender and short-lived emotion, and sometimes perishes after a few pages. Curiosity is tougher; but that, too, may be baffled too long, and end by tiring of the pursuit while it is yet in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many excellent plots, admirable from the constructive point of view, have been wasted by stringing them out too far; the reader recognizes their merit, but loses his enthusiasm on account of a sort of monotony of strain; he wickedly turns to the concluding chapter, and the game is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'The Woman in White,' by Wilkie Collins, was published about 1860, I think, in weekly installments, and certainly they were devoured with insatiable appetite by many thousands of readers. But I doubt whether a book of similar merit could command such a following today; and I will even confess that I have myself never read the concluding parts, and do not know to this day who the woman was or what were the wrongs from which she so poignantly suffered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories which ought to be shorter are sometimes made into novels by long and often tedious interpolations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; one of Conan Doyle's best stories, is unduly spun out by an interpolation which lasts from page 110 to 184. Likewise Gaboriau's &quot;The Mystery of Orcival&quot; has an interpolation from page 104 to 188. These extraneous narratives usually go back and tell of an episode that happened years before the scene of the story, and they are both uninteresting and inartistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, an author of detective fiction writes either short- stories or novels, but rarely both. Conan Doyle's only mystery novel is &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles;&quot; while Gaboriau and Anna Katharine Green invariably write novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we conclude that length is a matter of taste, and the detective fiction writer may use his own judgment as to the length of his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-narrator-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Narrator in the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teller of the Detective Story is an important factor in its technique. Many a good plot is spoiled because it is narrated by the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, with his quick sense of fitness, chose the narrator best calculated for the exploitation of his clever Dupin. This was a stroke of real genius, for the reader becomes acquainted with the principal through the subordinate. He is taught to look upon the work of a detective intelligently; taught to appreciate and understand it. He knows when it is time to applaud, because the narrator tells him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pity that this narrator is nameless, for as Mrs. Harris, with even less personality, is a household word, so his name would have been. It is this narrator who rouses our interest, tantalizes our impatience, and piques our curiosity, in harmony with his own halting almost unbelieving observance of the marvels revealed to him. He teaches us to be amazed at the proper time and then at the proper time he explains what so amazed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Watson, narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, is a parallel character, though in no sense an imitation or plagiarism. The conditions of the revelations to be made require just such a person to make them; and without a doubt, Sherlock Holmes would have had his Dr. Watson even if Dupin had never had his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the glory and honor cast upon the hero by this humble but adoring satellite, this means of narration has another decided advantage. Since the detective confides in his friend or not, as he chooses, the author can reveal or conceal facts as he chooses, and so mislead the reader at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the subordinate does not know he can not tell, and thus is the secret preserved. Again, the subordinate being but fallible, may surmise mistakenly. So then does the reader, and again the author's ends are served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the author prefers that the tale be told in the third person, but even so, the character of &quot;Harris&quot; is still usually in evidence. Often he is a reporter, for this gives him opportunity to go uninvited, yet free from the stigma of idle curiosity into the scenes of interest. A reporter eager for a &quot;scoop&quot; for his paper, sets a fine example of alert interest and close scrutiny for the reader to profit by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the foreword to &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; the hero detective picks out his reporter and tells him how useful he will be to him in his work. &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; has the reporter &quot;Hutchinson Hatch,&quot; while &quot;Rouletabille&quot; has a clever reporter named &quot;Sainclair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the story may be told directly from the mouth of the author. But the proportion of this manner of telling is not so large in Detective Story work as in other fiction; because there are secrets to be preserved. Not only the main secret of the mystery, but also the secrets of what the strange proceedings of the detective may mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the author is telling the tale, it is manifestly difficult for him to preserve an ingenuous and veracious manner, though this may be done if the author maintains a certain aloofness and an arbitrary standard of what to tell and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau's stories are all told in the third person; so are DuBoisgobey's and many of Anna Katharine Green's. Gaston Leroux uses this form and so does Mr. Webster in &quot;The Whispering Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a conglomeration of forms. The narrator is changed to suit the needs of the author, and the book is made up of the stories of the diaries of several people interested; &quot;The Woman in White&quot; follows the same narrative method. &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; is also told by various people, and sometimes in diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not always effective in other fiction, the diary is a most useful form for Detective Stories. For secrets can be confided to a diary, and though thus revealed to the reader, they are not disclosed to the other characters in the book; which is frequently a necessary condition. While never used for the whole book, the diary form often appears on certain pages of the story. &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; and many of our best authors' works show more or less of the useful and often necessary diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever narrator is chosen, let the choice be made after careful consideration of the conditions of the story. If there is a great surprise which must be concealed until the end, the narrator must be kept in ignorance of it until the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the story hinges on the marvelous brain work of a transcendent detective, give him a Dr. Watson to expatiate on it and to be awed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a scientific or other straightforward recital of procedure, it may be told by the author. These points can best be learned and understood by reading the works of the best authors and noting what kind of narrator they choose and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-setting&quot;&gt;The Setting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting of the story will of course depend on the plot; but, other things being equal, do not choose too low life for your scenes. The facts of a murder are in themselves sufficiently unattractive to make it unnecessary to add to the distastefulness of the story by unpleasant surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the people in your story be at least fairly well to do, of at least moderately good position and of a decent education. Unless absolutely necessary to have it otherwise, let the house or the scene of the crime be attractive or interesting, and let even the subordinate characters be of refined and intelligent type. For one reader who enjoys tales of slum life there are a dozen who prefer ladies and gentlemen, if not lords and ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be argued that murders or other crimes do not occur in high life as frequently as among the lower classes. This point may be open to discussion; but it would make no difference what the decision might be. Detective Stories are not realistic, and if the author choose to have his murder committed in a community of gentle-folk, he is entirely at liberty to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the locality and social customs of the story must be those with which the author is familiar. A Detective Story depends so much on the logic and plausibility of its conditions, that a vague or uncertain touch on the practical or material details greatly mars the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see to it, then, that our setting and our atmosphere are free from mistake or anachronism. Economy of attention demands that we keep the reader's mind wholly intent on the solution of the problem; and this may not be done if we allow questionable or contradictory work on the minor interests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desire, this evening, to consider Fiction as one of the Fine Arts. In order to do this, and before doing it, I have first to advance certain propositions. They are not new, they are not likely to be disputed, and yet they have never been so generally received as to form part, so to speak, of the national mind. These propositions are three, though the last two directly spring from the first. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Fiction is an Art in every way worthy to be called the sister and the equal of the Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Music, and Poetry; that is to say, her field is as boundless, her possibilities as vast, her excellences as worthy of admiration, as may be claimed for any of her sister Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That it is an Art which, like them, is governed and directed by general laws; and that these laws may be laid down and taught with as much precision and exactness as the laws of harmony, perspective, and proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That, like the other Fine Arts, Fiction is so far removed from the mere mechanical arts, that no laws or rules whatever can teach it to those who have not already been endowed with the natural and necessary gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the three propositions which I have to discuss. It follows as a corollary and evident deduction that, these propositions once admitted, those who follow and profess the Art of Fiction must be recognized as artists, in the strictest sense of the word, just as much as those who have delighted and elevated mankind by music and painting; and that the great Masters of Fiction must be placed on the same level as the great Masters in the other Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I mean that where the highest point, or what seems the highest point, possible in this Art is touched, the man who has reached it is one of the world's greatest men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot suppose that there are any in this room who would refuse to admit these propositions; on the contrary, they will seem to most here self-evident; yet the application of theory to practice, of principle to persons, may be more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, so boundless is the admiration for great Masters such as Raphael or Mozart, that if one were to propose that Thackeray should be placed beside them, on the same level, and as an equal, there would ho felt by most a certain shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting that the art of Thackeray is to be compared with that of Raphael, or that there is any similarity in the work of the two men; I only say that, Fiction being one Art, and Painting another and a sister those who attain the highest possible distinction in either are equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us, however, go outside this room, among the multitudes by whom a novelist has never been considered an artist at all. To them the claim that a great novelist should be considered to occupy the same level as a great musician, a great painter, or a great poet, would appear at first a thing ludicrous and even painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment how the world at large regards the novelist. He is, in their eyes, a person who tells stories, just as they used to regard the actor as a man who tumbled on the stage to make the audience laugh, and a musician as a man who fiddled to make the people dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the old way of thinking, and most people think first as they have been taught to think; and next as they see others think. It is therefore quite easy to understand why the art of novel-writing has always been, by the general mass, undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, while the leaders in every other branch of Art, in every department of Science, and in every kind of profession, receive their share of the ordinary national distinctions, no one ever hears of honors being bestowed upon novelists. Neither Thackeray nor Dickens was ever, so far as I know, offered a Peerage; neither King, Queen, nor Prince in any country throughout the whole world takes the least notice of them. I do not say they would be any the better for this kind of recognition, but its absence clearly proves, to those who take their opinions from others, that they are not a class at all worthy of special honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, in the modern craze which exists for every kind of art — so that we meet everywhere, in every household, amateur actors, painters, etchers, sculptors, modellers, musicians, and singers, all of them serious and earnest in their aims — amateur novelists alone regard their Art as one which is learned by intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, novelists are not associated as are painters; they hold no annual exhibitions, dinners, or conversazioni; they put no letters after their name; they have no President or Academy; and they do not themselves seem desirous of being treated as folio were of a special Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not say that they are wrong, or that much would be gained for Art if all the novelists of England were invited to Court and created into a Royal Academy. But I do say that for these three reasons it is easy to understand how the world at large does not even suspect that the writing of novels is one of the Fine Arts, and why they regard the story-teller with a sort of contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, I acknowledge, a kindly contempt — even an affectionate contempt; it is the contempt which the practical man feels for the dreamer, the strong man for the weak, the man who can do for the man who can only look on and talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general — the Philistine — view of the Profession is, first of all, that it is not one which a scholar and a man of serious views should take up: the telling of stories is inconsistent with a well-balanced mind; to be a teller of stories disqualifies one from a hearing on important subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this very day there are thousands of living people who will never understand how the author of &quot;Coningsby &quot; and &quot; Vivian Grey &quot; can possibly be regarded as a serious statesman — all the Disraeli literature, even to the comic cartoons, expresses the popular sentiment that a novelist must not presume to call himself a statesman; the intellect of a novelist, it is felt, if he have any intellect at all, which is doubtful, must be one of the most frivolous and lightest kind; how can a man whose mind is always full of the loves of Corydon and Amaryllis be trusted to form an opinion on practical matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Thackeray ventured to contest the city of Oxford, we know what happened. He thought his failure was because the people of Oxford had never even heard of him; I think otherwise. I think it was because it was whispered from house to house and was carried from shop to shop, and was mentioned in the vestry, that this fellow from London, who asked for their votes, was nothing but a common novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these people must not be confounded another class, not so large, who are prepared to admit that Fiction is in some qualified sense an Art; but they do this as a concession to the vanity of its followers, and are by no means prepared to allow that it is an Art of the first rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can that be an Art, they might ask, which has nolecturers or teachers, no school or college or Academy, no recognized rules, no text-books, and is not taught in any University? Even the German Universities, which teach everything else, do not have Professors of Fiction, and not one single novelist, so far as I know, has ever pretended to teach his mystery, or spoken of it as a thing which may be taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, therefore, they would go on to argue, such art as is required for the making and telling of a story can and must be mastered without study, because no materials exist for the student's use. It may even, perhaps, be acquired unconsciously or by imitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view, I am sorry to say, largely prevails among the majority of those who try their chance in the field of fiction. Anyone, they think, can write a novel; therefore, why not sit down and write one? I would not willingly say one word which might discourage those who are attracted to this branch of literature; on the contrary, I would encourage them in every possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One desires, however, that they should approach their work at the outset with the same serious and earnest appreciation of its importance and its difficulties with which they undertake the study of music and painting. I would wish, in short, that from the very beginning their minds should be fully possessed with the knowledge that Fiction is an Art, and, like all other Arts, that it is governed by certain laws, methods, and rules, which it is their first business to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is then, first and before all, a real Art. It is the oldest, because it was known and practised long before Painting and her sisters were in existence or even thought of; it is older than any of the Muses from whose company she who tells stories has hitherto been excluded; it is the most widely spread, because in no race of men under the sun is it unknown, even though the stories may be always the same, and handed down from generation to generation in the same form; it is the most religious of all the Arts, because in every age until the present the lives, exploits, and sufferings of gods, goddesses, saints, and heroes have been the favorite theme; it has always been the most popular, because it requires neither culture, education, nor natural genius to understand and listen to a story; it is the most moral, because the world has always been taught whatever little morality it possesses by way of story, fable, apologue, parable, and allegory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It commands the widest influence, because it can be carried easily and everywhere, into regions where pictures are never seen and music is never heard; it is the greatest teaching power, because its lessons are most readily apprehended and understood. All this, which might have been said thousands of years ago, may be said today with even greater force and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That world which exists not, but is an invention or an imitation— that world in which the shadows and shapes of men move about before our eyes as real as ifthey were actually living and speaking among us, is like a great theatre accessible to all of every sort, on whose stage are enacted, at our own sweet will, whenever we please to command them, the most beautiful plays; it is, as every theatre should be, the school in which manners are learned; here the majority of reading mankind learn nearly all that they know of life and manners, of philosophy and art; even of science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern novel converts abstract ideas into living models; it gives ideas, it strengthens faith, it preaches a higher morality than is seen in the actual world; it commands the emotions of pity, admiration, and terror; it creates and keeps alive the sense of sympathy; it is the universal teacher; it is the only book which the great mass of reading mankind ever do read; it is the only way in which people can learn what other men and women are like; it redeems their lives from dulness, puts thoughts, desires, knowledge, and even ambitions into their hearts; it teaches them to talk, and enriches their speech with epigrams, anecdotes and illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an unfailing source of delight to millions, happily not too critical. Why, out of all the books taken down from the shelves of the public libraries, four-fifths are novels, and of all those that are bought nine- tenths are novels. Compared with this tremendous engine of popular influence, what are all the other Arts put together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we not alter the old maxim, and say with truth, Let him who pleases make the laws if I may write the novels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the field with which this Art of Fiction occupies itself, it is, if you please, nothing less than the whole of Humanity. The novelist studies men and women; he is concerned with their actions and their thoughts, their errors and their follies, their greatness and their meanness; the countless forms of beauty and constantly varying moods to be seen among them; the forces which act upon them; the passions, prejudices, hopes and fears which pull them this way and that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has to do, above all, and before all, with men and women. No one, for instance, among novelists, can be called a landscape painter, or a painter of sea-pieces, or a painter of fruit and flowers, save only in strict subordination to the group of characters with whom he is dealing. Landscape, sea, sky, and air, are merely accessories introduced in order to set off and bring into greater prominence the figures on the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first rule in Fiction is that the human interest must absolutely absorb everything else. Some writers never permit anything at all in their pages which shall divert our thoughts one moment from the actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, for instance, Charles Reade — Alas! that we must say the late Charles Reade, for he is dead — when this great Master of Fiction, in his incomparable tale of the &quot; Cloister and the Hearth,&quot; sends Gerard and Denis the Burgundian on that journey through France, it is with the fewest possible of words that he suggests the sights and persons met with on the way ; yet, so great is thewhere lurk the routiers and the robbers, the cut-throat inn, the merchants, peasants, beggars, soldiers who go riding by; the writer does not pause in his story to tell us of all this, but yet we feel it — by the mere action of the piece and the dialogue we are compelled to see the scenery: the life of the fifteenth century passes before us, with hardly a word to picture it, because it is always kept in the background, so as not to interfere with the central figure of the young clerk journeying to Home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human interest in Fiction, then, must come before aught else. It is of this world, wholly of this world. It might seem at first as if the limitation of this Art to things human placed it on a lower level than the Arts of Painting and Music. That, however, is not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupendous subjects which were undertaken by the old Italian painters are, it is true, beyond the power of Fiction to attempt. It may be questioned whether they are not also, according to modern ideas, beyond the legitimate scope of painting. Certainly, just as there is nothing in the whole of creation more worthy of being studied and painted than the human face and form, so there is nothing more worthy of representation than men and women in action and in passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient poet placed the gods themselves upon the stage with the Furies and the Fates. Thenwe had the saints, confessors, and martyrs. We next descended to kings and great lords; in our times painter, poet, and novelist alike are contented with plain humanity, whether crowned or in rags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What picture, let us ask, what picture ever painted of angels and blessed souls, even if they are mounting the hill on which stands the Four Square City of the jasper wall, is able to command our interest and sympathy more profoundly than the simple and faithful story, truly and faithfully told, of a lover and his mistress?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, therefore, the especial characteristic of this Art, that, since it deals exclusively with men and women, it not only requires of its followers, but also creates in readers, that sentiment which is destined to be a most mighty engine in deepening and widening the civilization of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call it &lt;em&gt;Sympathy&lt;/em&gt;, but it means a great deal more than was formerly understood by the word. It means, in fact, what Professor Seeley once called the Enthusiasm of Humanity, and it first appeared, I think, about a hundred and fifty years ago, when the modern novel came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find it, for instance, conspicuous for its absence in Defoe. The modern Sympathy includes not only the power to pity the sufferings of others, but also that of understanding their very souls; it is the reverence for man, the respect for his personality, the recognition of his individuality, and the enormous value of the one man, the perception of one man's relation to another, hisduties and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the strength of this newly-born faculty, and aided by the guidance of a great artist, we are enabled to discern the real indestructible man beneath the rags and filth of a common castaway, and the possibilities of the meanest gutter-child that steals in the streets for its daily bread. Surely that is a wonderful Art which endows the people — all the people — with this power of vision and of feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Painting has not done it, and could never do it; Painting has done more for nature than for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculpture could not do it, because it deals with situation and form rather than action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music cannot do it, because Music (if I understand rightly) appeals especially to the individual concerning himself and his own aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poetry alone is the rival of Fiction, and in this respect it takes a lower place, not because Poetry fails to teach and interpret, but because Fiction is, and must always be, more popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this Art teaches, like the others, by suppression and reticence. Out of the great procession of Humanity, the &lt;em&gt;Comédie Surname&lt;/em&gt; which the novelist sees passing ever before his eyes, single figures detach themselves one after the other, to be questioned, examined, and received or rejected. This process goes on perpetually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity is so vast a field that to one who goes about watching men and women, and does not sit at home and evolve figures out of inner consciousness, there is not, and can never be, any end or limit to the freshness and interest ofthese figures. It is the work of the artist to select the figures, to suppress, to copy, to group, and to work up the incidents which each one offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily life of the world is not dramatic — it is monotonous; the novelist makes it dramatic by his silences, his suppressions, and his exaggerations. No one, for example, in fiction behaves quite in the same way as in real life; as on the stage, if an actor unfolds and reads a letter, the simple action is done with an exaggeration of gesture which calls attention to the thing and to its importance; so in romance, while nothing should be allowed which does not carry on the story, so everything as it occurs must be accentuated and yet deprived of needless accessory details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gestures of the characters at an important juncture, their looks, their voices, may all be noted if they help to impress the situation. Even the weather, the wind and the rain, with some writers, have been made to emphasize a mood or a passion of a heroine. To know how to use these aids artistically is to the novelist exactly what to the actor is the right presentation of a letter, the handing of a chair, even the removal of a glove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-third-characteristic-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Third Characteristic of Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third characteristic of Fiction, which should alone be sufficient to give it a place among the noblest forms of Art, is that, like Poetry, Painting, and Music, it becomes a vehicle, not only for the best thoughts of the writer, but also for those of the reader, so that a novelist may write truthfully and faithfully, but simply, and yet be understood in afar fuller and nobler sense than was present to his own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This power is the very highest gift of the poet. He has a vision and sees a thing clearly, yet perhaps afar off; another who reads him is enabled to get the same vision, to see the same thing, yet closer and more distinctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lower intellect thus to lead and instruct a higher is surely a very great gift, and granted only to the highest forms of Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this it is which Fiction of the best kind does for its readers. It is, however, only another way of saying that Truth in Fiction produces effects similar to those produced by Truth in every other Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, then, I have showed that this Art of Fiction is the most ancient of all Arts and the most popular; that its field is the whole of humanity; that it creates and develops that sympathy which is a kind of second sight; that, like all other Arts, its function is to select, to suppress, and to arrange; that it suggests as well as narrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More might be said — a great deal more — but enough has been said to show that in these, the leading characteristics of any Art, Fiction is on exactly the same level as her sisters. Let me only add that in this Art, as in the others, there is, and will be always, whatever has been done already, something new to discover, something new to express, something new to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surgeons dissect the body, and account for every bone and every nerve, so that the body of one man, considered as a collection of bones and nerves,is so far exactly like the body of another man. But the mind of man cannot be so exhausted: it yields discoveries to every patient student; it is absolutely inexhaustible; it is to every one a fresh and virgin field; and the most successful investigator leaves regions and tracts for his successor as vast as those he has himself gone over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, after all, the greatest Psychologist is not the metaphysician, but the novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-laws-general-rules-and-principles-governing-the-art-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Laws, General Rules, and Principles Governing the Art of Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come next to speak of the Laws which govern this Art. I mean those general rules and principles which must necessarily be acquired by every writer of Fiction before he can even hope for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules will not make a man a novelist, any more than a knowledge of grammar makes a man know a language, or a knowledge of musical science makes a man able to play an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Rules must be learned. And, in speaking of them, one is compelled, so close is the connection between the sister Arts, to use not only the same terms, but also to adopt the same rules, as those laid down by painters for their students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these Laws appear self-evident, it is a proof that the general principles of the Art are well understood. Considering, however, the vast quantity of bad, inartistic work which is every week laid before the public, one is inclined to think that a statement of these principles may not be without usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and before everything else, there is the Rule that everything in Fiction which is invented and is not the result of personal experience and observation is worthless. In some other Arts, the design may follow any lines which the designer pleases: it may be fanciful, unreal, or grotesque; but in modem Fiction, whose sole end, aim, and purpose is to portray humanity and human character, the design must be in accordance with the customs and general practice of living men and women under any proposed set of circumstances and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is to say, the characters must be real, and such as might be met with in actual life, or, at least, the natural developments of such people as any of us might meet; their actions must be natural and consistent; the conditions of place, of manners, and of thought must be drawn from personal observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take an extreme case: a young lady brought up in a quiet country village should avoid descriptions of garrison life; a writer whose friends and personal experiences belong to what we call the lower middle class should carefully avoid introducing his characters into Society; a South-countryman would hesitate before attempting to reproduce the North-country accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple Rule, but one to which there should be no exception — never to go beyond your own experience. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been objected to this Rule that, if followed, it would entirely shut out the historical novel. Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest of the historical novel, as of any other novel, depends upon the experience and knowledge which the writer has of humanity, men and women being pretty much alike in all ages. It is not the setting that we regard, so much as thethat most of the people who read novels, and know nothing about the art of writing them, recognize before any other quality that of fidelity; the greatness of a novelist they measure chiefly by the knowledge of the world displayed in his pages; the highest praise they can bestow upon him is that he has drawn the story to the life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exactly the same with a picture. If you go to the Academy any day, and listen to the comments of the crowd,acting of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting in an historical novel is very often absurd, incorrect, and incongruous; but the human interest, the skill and knowledge of character shown by the writer, may make us forget the errors of the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, &amp;quot;Romola&amp;quot; is undoubtedly a great novel, not because it contains a true, and therefore valuable, reproduction of Florentine life in the time of the early Renaissance, for it does not; nor because it gives us the ideas of the age, for it does not; the characters, especially that of the heroine, being fully of nineteenth century ideas: but it is great as a study of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in the &amp;quot;Cloister and the Hearth,&amp;quot; we do really have a description of the time and its ideas, taken bodily, sometimes almost literally, from the pages of the man who most truly represents them — Erasmus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that here is a rule for the historical novelist — when he must describe, he must borrow. If it be objected, again, that he may do the same thing with contemporary life, I reply that be may, if he please, but he will most assuredly be found out through some blunder, omission, or confusion caused by ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt the same blunders are perpetrated by the historical novelist; but these are not so readily found out except by an archaeologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, one who desires to reproduce a time gone by would not go to the poets, the divines, the historians, so much as to the familiar literature, the letters, comedies, tales, essayists, and newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- end div.sidenote --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that most of the people who read novels, and know nothing about the art of writing them, recognize before any other quality that of fidelity; the greatness of a novelist they measure chiefly by the knowledge of the world displayed in his pages; the highest praise they can bestow upon hi is that he has drawn the story to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exactly the same with a picture. If you go to the Academy any day, and listen to the comments of the crowd, which is a very instructive thing to do, and one recommended to young novelists, you will presently become aware that the only thing they look for in a picture is the story which it tells, and therefore the fidelity with which it is presented on the canvas. Most of the other qualities of the picture, and of the novel as well, all that has to do with the technique, escape the general observer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-art-of-description&quot;&gt;The Art of Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being so, the first thing which has to be acquired is the art of description. It seems easy to describe; any one, it seems, can set down what he sees. But consider. How much does he see? There is everywhere, even in a room, such a quantity of things to he seen: far, far more in field and hedge, in mountain and in forest and beside the stream, are there countless things to he seen; the unpractised eye sees nothing, or next to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a tree, here is a flower, there is sunshine lying on the hill. But to the observant and trained eye, the intelligent eye, there lies before him everywhere an inexhaustible and bewildering mass of things to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how Mr. Jefferies sits down in a coppice with his eyes wide open to see what the rest of us never dreamed of looking for. Long before he has half-finished telling us what he has seen—behold! a volume, and one of the most delightful volumes conceivable. But, then, Mr. Jefferies is a profound naturalist. We cannot all describe after his manner; nor should we try, for the simple reason that descriptions of still life in anovel must be strictly subordinated to the human interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Mr. Jefferies has his hedge and ditch and brook, we have our towns, our villages, and our assemblies of men and women. Among them we must not only observe, but we must select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, then, are two distinct faculties which the intending novelist must acquire; viz., observation and selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the power of observation, it may be taught to any one by the simple method adopted by Robert Houdin, the French conjuror. This method consists of noting down continually and remembering all kinds of things remarked in the course of a journey, a walk, or the day's business. The learner must carry his note-book always with him, into the fields, to the theatre, into the streets — wherever he can watch man and his ways, or Nature and her ways. On his return home he should enter his notes in his commonplace-book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places where the production of a notebook would be embarrassing — say, at a dinner party, or a street fight; yet the man who begins to observe will speedily be able to remember everything that he sees and hears until he can find an opportunity to note it down, so that nothing is lost. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I earnestly recommend those who desire to study this Art to begin by daily practice in the description of things, even common things, that they have observed, by reporting conversations, and by word portraits of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will find that the practice gives them firmness of outline, quickness of observation, power of catching important details, and, as regards dialog, readiness to see what is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary practice and study of this kind will also lead to the saving of a vast quantity of valuable material, which is only wasted by being prematurely worked up into a novel written before the elements of the Art have been acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials for the novelist, in short, are not in the books upon the shelves, but in the men and women he meets with everywhere; he will find them, where Dickens found them, in the crowded streets, in trains, tramcars and omnibuses, at the shop-windows, in churches and chapels; his materials are everywhere — there is nothing too low, nothing too high, nothing too base, nothing too noble, for the novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity is like a kaleidoscope, which you may turn about and look into, but you will never get the same picture twice — it cannot be exhausted. But it may be objected, that the broad distinctive types have been long since all used. They have been used, but the comfort is that they can never be used up, and that they may be constantly used again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we ever be tired of them when a master hand takes one of them again and gives him new life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there to be no more hypocrites because we have already had Tartufe and Pecksniff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we suppose that the old miser, the young spendthrift, the gambler, the adventurer, the coquette, the drunkard, the soldier of fortune, are never to reappear, because they have been handled already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long, on the contrary, as man shall continue story-telling, so long will these characters occur again and again, and look as fresh each time that they are treated by a master's hand as if they were newly discovered types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity, therefore, can be only assured by acquiring the art of observation, which further assists in filling the mind with stored experience. I am quite sure that most men never see anything at all. I have known men who have even gone all round the world and seen nothing — no, nothing at all. Emerson says, very truly, that a traveller takes away nothing from a place except what he brought into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the observation of things around us is no part of the ordinary professional and commercial life; it has nothing at all to do with success and the making of money; so that we do not learn to observe. Yet it is very easy to shake people and make them open their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us remember, for instance, the time when Kingsley astonished everybody with his descriptions of the wonders to be seen on the seashore and to be fished out of every pond in the field. Then all the world began to poke about the seaweed and to catch tritons and keep water-grubs in little tanks. It was only a fashion, and it presently died out; but it did people good, because it made them understand, perhaps for the first time, that there really is a good deal more to see than meets the casual eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present the lesson which we need is not that the world is full of the most strange and wonderful creatures, all eating each other perpetually, but that the world is full of the most wonderful men and women, not one of whom is mean orcommon, but to each his own personality is a great and awful thing, worthy of the most serious study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-power-of-selection-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Power of Selection in Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, then, abundant materials waiting to be picked up by any who has the wit to see them lying at his feet and all around him. What is next required is the power of Selection. Can this be taught? I think not, at least I do not know how, unless it is by reading. In every Art, selection requires that kind of special fitness for the Art which is included in the much abused word Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fiction the power of selection requires a large share of the dramatic sense. Those who already possess this faculty will not go wrong if they bear in mind the simple rule that nothing should be admitted which does not advance the story, illustrate the characters, bring into stronger relief the hidden forces which act upon them, their emotions, their passions, and their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All descriptions which hinder instead of helping the action, all episodes of whatever kind, all conversation which does not either advance the story or illustrate the characters, ought to be rigidly suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely connected with selection is dramatic presentation. Given a situation, it should be the first care of the writer to present it as dramatically, that is to say as forcibly, as possible. The grouping and setting of the picture, the due subordination of description to dialogue, the rapidity of the action, those things which naturally suggest themselves to the practised eye, deserve to be very carefully considered by the beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a novel is like aplay: it may be divided into scenes and acts, tableaus and situations, separated by the end of the chapter instead of the drop-scene: the writer is the dramatist, stage-manager, scene-painter, actor, and carpenter, all in one; it is his single business to see that none of the scenes flag or fall flat: he must never for one moment forget to consider how the piece is looking from the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;character-in-fiction&quot;&gt;Character in Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next simple Rule is that the drawing of each figure must be clear in outline, and, even if only sketched, must be sketched without hesitation. This can only be done when the writer himself sees his figures clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters in fiction do not, it must be understood, spring Minerva-like from the brain. They grow; they grow sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. From the first moment of conception, that is to say, from the first moment of their being seen and caught, they grow continuously and almost without mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do not grow and become every day clearer, they had better be put aside at once, and forgotten as soon as may be, because that is a proof that the author does not understand the character he has himself endeavored to create. To have on one's hands a half-created being without the power of finishing him must be a truly dreadful thing. The only way out of it is to kill and bury him at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always thought, for instance, that the figure of Daniel Deronda, whose portrait, blurred and uncertain as it is, has been drawn with the most amazing care andwith endless touches and retouches, must have become at last to George Eliot a kind of awful veiled spectre, always in her brain, always seeming about to reveal his true features and his mind, but never doing it, so that to the end she never clearly perceived what manner of man he was, nor what was his real character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what the author cannot set down, the reader cannot understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, how possible, how capable of development, how real becomes a true figure, truly understood by the creator, and truly depicted! Do we not know what they would say and think under all conceivable conditions? We can dress them as we will; we can place them in any circumstances of life: we can always trust them because they will never fail us, never disappoint us, never change, because we understand them so thoroughly. So well do we know them that they become our advisers, our guides, and our best friends, on whom we model ourselves, our thoughts, and our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer who has succeeded in drawing to the life, true, clear, distinct, so that all may understand, a single figure of a true man or woman, has added another exemplar or warning to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, then, it must be insisted upon as of the greatest importance, should be begun in writing until the characters are so clear and distinct in the brain, so well known, that they will act their parts, bend their dialogue, and suit their action to whatever situations they may find themselves in, if only theyare becoming to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, clear outline drawing is best when it is accomplished in the fewest strokes, and the greater part of the figures in Fiction, wherein it differs from Painting, in which everything should be finished, require no more work upon them, in order to make them clear, than half- a-dozen bold, intelligible lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the methods of conveying a clear understanding of a character, they are many. The first and the easiest is to make it clear by reason of some mannerism or personal peculiarity, some trick of speech or of carriage. This is the worst, as may generally be said of the easiest way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another easy method is to describe your character at length. This also is a bad, because a tedious, method. If, however, you read a page or two of any good writer, you will discover that he first makes a character intelligible by a few words, and then allows him to reveal himself in action and dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, nothing is more inartistic than to be constantly calling attention in a dialogue to a gesture or a look, to laughter or to tears. The situation generally requires no such explanation: in some well-known scenes which I could quote, there is not a single word to emphasize or explain the attitude, manner, and look of the speakers, yet they are as intelligible as if they were written down and described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the highest art which carries the reader along and makes him see, without being told, the changing expressions, the gestures of the speakers,and hear the varying tones of their voices. It is as if one should close one's eyes at the theatre, and yet continue to see the actors on the stage as well as hear their voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only writer who can do this is he who makes his characters intelligible from the very outset, causes them first to stand before the reader in clear outline, and then with every additional line brings out the figure, fills up the face, and makes his creatures grow from the simple outline more and more to the perfect and rounded figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearness of drawing, which includes clearness of vision, also assists in producing directness of purpose. As soon as the actors in the story become real in the mind of the narrator, and not before, the story itself becomes real to him. More than this, he becomes straightway vehemently impelled to tell it, and he is moved to tell it in the best and most direct way, the most dramatic way, the most truthful way possible to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, in fact, only when the writer believes his own story, and knows it to be every word true, and feels that he has somehow learned from everyone concerned the secret history of his own part in it, that he can really begin to write it. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardly anything is more important than this — to believe in your own story. Therefore let the student remember that unless the characters exist and move about in his brain, all separate, distinct, living, and perpetually engaged in the action of the story, sometimes at one part of it, sometimes at another, and that in scenes and places which must be omitted in the writing, he has got no story to tell and had better give it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think it is generally understood that there are thousands of scenes which belong to the story and never get outside the writer&amp;#39;s brain at all. Some of these may be very beautiful and touching; but there is not room for all, and the writer has to select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know how sometimes, even from a practised hand, there comes a work marred with the fatal defect that the writer does not believe in his own story. When this is the case, one may generally find on investigation that one cause at least of the failure is that the characters, or some of them, are blurred and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the modern English novel, whatever form it takes, almost always starts with a conscious moral purpose. When it does not, so much are we accustomed to expect it, that one feels as if there has been a debasement of the Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, fortunately, not possible in this country for any man to defile and defame humanity and still be called an artist; the development of modern sympathy, the growing reverence for the individual, the ever-widening love of things beautiful and the appreciation of lives made beautiful by devotion and self-denial, the sense of personal responsibility among the English-speaking races, the deep-seated religion of our people, even in a time of doubt, are all forces which act strongly upon the artist as well as upon his readers, and lend to his work, whether he will or not, a moral purpose so clearly marked that it has become practically a law of English Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must acknowledge that this is a truly admirable thing,and a great cause for congratulation. At the same time, one may be permitted to think that the preaching novel is the least desirable of any, and to be unfeignedly rejoiced that the old religious novel, written in the interests of High Church or Low Church or any other Church, has gone out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fidelity-truth-and-harmony-observed-in-fiction&quot;&gt;Fidelity, Truth, and Harmony Observed in Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, just as in Painting and Sculpture, not only are fidelity, truth, and harmony to be observed in Fiction, but also beauty of workmanship. It is almost impossible to estimate too highly the value of careful workmanship, that is, of style. Everyone, without exception, of the great Masters in Fiction, has recognized this truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will hardly find a single page in any of them which is not carefully and even elaborately worked up. I think there is no point on which critics of novels should place greater importance than this, because it is one which young novelists are so very liable to ignore. There ought not to be in a novel, any more than in a poem, a single sentence carelessly worded, a single phrase which has not been considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, if you please, any one of the great scenes in Fiction — how much of the effect is due to the style, the balanced sentences, the very words used by the narrator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, is only one more point of similarity between Fiction and the sister Arts. There is, I know, the danger of attaching too much attention to style at the expense of situation, and so falling a prey to priggishness, fashions, and mannerisms of the day. It is certainly a danger; at the same time, it sometimes seems, when one reads the slipshod, careless English which is often thought good enough for story-telling, that it is almost impossible to overrate the value of style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is comfort in the thought that no reputation worth having can be made without attending to style, and that there is no style, however rugged, which cannot be made beautiful by attention and pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many times,&quot; a writer once asked a girl who brought him her first effort for advice and criticism; &quot;how many times have you re-written this page?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She confessed that she had written it once for all, had never read it afterwards, and had not the least idea that there was such a thing as style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it not presumptuous in the highest degree to believe that what one has produced without pains, thought, or trouble will give any pleasure to the reader?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, every scene, however unimportant, should be completely and carefully finished. There should be no unfinished places, no sign anywhere of weariness or haste — in fact, no scamping. The writer must so love his work as to dwell tenderly on every age and be literally unable to send forth a single page of it without the finishing touches. We all of us remember that kind of novel in which every scene has the appearance of being hurried and scamped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-requirements-of-the-art-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Requirements of the Art of Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up these few preliminary and generallaws. The Art of Fiction requires first of all the power of description, truth, and fidelity, observation, selection, clearness of conception and of outline, dramatic grouping, directness of purpose, a profound belief on the part of the story-teller in the reality of his story, and beauty of workmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, moreover, an Art which requires of those who follow it seriously that they must be unceasingly occupied in studying the ways of mankind, the social laws, the religions, philosophies, tendencies, thoughts, prejudices, superstitions of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They must consider as many of the forces which act upon classes and upon individuals as they can discover; they should be always trying to put themselves into the place of another; they must be as inquisitive and as watchful as a detective, as suspicious as a criminal lawyer, as eager for knowledge as a physicist, and withal fully possessed of that spirit to which nothing appears mean, nothing contemptible, nothing unworthy of study, which belongs to human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeat that I submit some of these laws as perhaps self-evident. If that is so, many novels which are daily submitted to the reviewer are written in wilful neglect and disobedience of them. But they are not really self-evident; those who aspire to be artists in Fiction almost invariably begin without any understanding at all of these laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the lamentable early failures, the waste of good material, and the low level of Art with which both thenovel-writer and the novel-reader are too often contented. I am certain that if these laws were better known and more generally studied, a very large proportion of the bad works of which our critics complain would not be produced at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am in great hopes that one effect of the establishment of the newly founded Society of Authors will be to keep young writers of fiction from rushing too hastily into print, to help them to the right understanding of their Art and its principles, and to guide them into true practice of their principles while they are still young, their imaginations strong, and their personal experiences as yet not wasted in foolish failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-most-important-point-of-the-art-of-fiction--the-story&quot;&gt;The Most Important Point of the Art of Fiction – The Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all these preliminary studies there comes the most important point of all — the story. There is a school which pretends that there is no need for a story: all the stories, they say, have been told already; there is no more room for invention: nobody wants any longer to listen to a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hears this kind of talk with the same wonder which one feels when a new monstrous fashion changes the beautiful figure of woman into something grotesque and unnatural. Men say these things gravely to each other, especially men who have no story to tell: other men listen gravely; in the same way women put on the newest and most preposterous fashions gravely, and look upon each other without either laughing or hiding their faces for shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, indeed, if we think of it, a most strange and wonderful theory, that we should continue to care for Fiction and cease to care for the story. We have all along been training ourselves how to tell the story, and here is this new school which steps in, like the needy knife-grinder, to explain that there is no story left at all to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, the story is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot conceive of a world going on at all without stories, and those strong ones, with incident in them, and merriment and pathos, laughter and tears, and the excitement of wondering what will happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, these new theorists contradict themselves, because they find it impossible to write a novel which shall not contain a story, although it may be but a puny bantling. Fiction without adventure — a drama without a plot — a novel without surprises — the thing is as impossible as life without uncertainty. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correspondent asks me if I do not like the work of Mr. Howells. Of course one cannot choose but like his writing. But one cannot also avoid comparing his work with that of his countryman, Nathaniel Hawthorne, who added to the charm of style the interest of a romantic and exciting story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the story, then. And here theory and teaching can go no farther. For every Art there is the corresponding science which may be taught. We have been speaking of the corresponding science. But the Art itself can neither be taught nor communicated. If the thing is in a man he will bring it out somehow, well or badly, quickly or slowly. If it is not, he can never learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here,then, let us suppose that we have to do with the mail to whom the invention of stories is part of his nature. We will also suppose that he has mastered the laws of his Art, and is now anxious to apply them. To such a man one can only recommend that he should with the greatest care and attention analyze and examine the construction of certain works, which are acknowledged to be of the first rank in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them, not to speak of Scott, he might pay especial attention, from the constructive point of view, to the truly admirable shorter stories of Charles Reade, to George Eliot's &quot;Silas Marner,&quot; the most perfect of English novels, Hawthorne's &quot;Scarlet Letter,&quot; Holmes's &quot;Elsie Venner,&quot; Blackmore's &quot;Lorna Doone,&quot; or Black's &quot;Daughter of Heth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He must not sit down to read them &quot;for the story,&quot; as uncritical people say; he must read them slowly and carefully, perhaps backwards, so as to discover for himself how the author built up the novel, and from what original germ or conception it sprang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take another novel by another writer to illustrate my meaning. It is James Payn's &quot;Confidential Agent,&quot; a work showing, if I may be permitted to say so, constructive power of the very highest order. You have all, without doubt, read that story. As you know, it turns upon a diamond robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the unpractised hand it would seem as if stories of theft had already been told ad nauseam. The man of experience knows better: he knows that in his hands every story becomes new,because he can place it upon his stage with new incidents, new conditions, and new actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Payn connects his diamonds with three or four quite ordinary families: he does not search for strange and eccentric characters, but uses the folk he sees around him, plain middle-class people, to whom most of us belong. He does not try to show these people cleverer, better cultured, or in any respect at all other than they really are, except that some of them talk a little better than in real life they would be likely to do. That is to say, in dialogue he exercises the art of selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, in this quiet household of age and youth, love and happiness, there happens a dreadful thing: the young husband vanishes amid circumstances which give rise to the most horrible suspicions. How this event acts upon the minds of the household and their friends; how the faith, sorely tried, of one breaks down, and that of another remains steadfast; how the truth is gradually disclosed, and the innocence of the suspected man is made clear — all this should be carefully examined by the student as a lesson in construction and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will not, one hopes, neglect the other lesson taught him by this novel, which is the art of telling the story, selecting the actors, and skilfully using the plain and simple materials which lie around us everywhere ready to our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite sure that the chief lesson to be learned from the study of nearly all our own modern novelists is that adventure, pathos,amusement, and interest, are far better sought among lives which seem dull, and among people who seem at first beyond the reach of romance, than from eccentricity and peculiarity of manner, or from violent and extreme reverses and accidents of fortune. This is, indeed, only another aspect of the increased value which we have learned to attach to individual life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing more the Art student has to learn. Let him not only believe his own story before he begins to tell it, but let him remember that in story-telling, as in almsgiving, a cheerful countenance works wonders, and a hearty manner greatly helps the teller and pleases the listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would not have the novelist make continual efforts at being comic; but let him not tell his story with eyes full of sadness, a face of woe and a shaking voice. His story may be tragic, but continued gloom is a mistake in Art, even for a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If his story is a comedy, all the more reason to tell it cheerfully and brightly. Lastly, let him tell it without apparent effort: without trying to show his cleverness, his wit, his powers of epigram, and his learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet let him pour without stint or measure into his work all that he knows, all that he has seen, all that he has observed, and all that he has remembered; all that there is of nobility, sympathy, and enthusiasm in himself. Let him spare nothing, but lavish all that he has, in the full confidence that the wells will not be dried up, and that the springs of fancy andimagination will flow again, even though he seem to have exhausted himself in this one effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, therefore, we may leave the student of this Art &lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#appendix&quot;&gt;See Appendix&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;. It remains for him to show whether he does wisely in following it farther. Of one thing for his encouragement he may rest assured; in the Art of Fiction more than in any other it is easy to gain recognition, far easier than in any of the sister Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the English school of painting, for example, there are already so many good men in the field that it is most difficult to win an acknowledged position ; in the drama it is next to impossible to get a play produced, in spite of our thirty London theatres; in poetry it seems almost hopeless to get a hearing, even if one has reached the second rank; hut in Fiction the whole of the English-speaking race are always eager to welcome a newcomer; good work is instantly recognized, and the only danger is that the universal cry for more may lead to hasty and immature production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean that ready recognition will immediately bring with it a great pecuniary success. Unfortunately, there has grown up of late a bad fashion of measuring success too much by the money it seems to command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not always, remember, the voice of the people which elects the best man, and though in most cases it follows that a successful novelist commands a large sale of his works, it may happen that the Art of a great writer is of such a kind that it may never become widelypopular. There have been among us two or three such writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One case will immediately occur to most of us here. It is that of a man whose books are filled with wisdom, experience, and epigram; whose characters are most admirably studied from the life, whose plots are ingenious, situations fresh, and dialogues extraordinarily clever. Yet he has never been widely popular, and, I am sure, never will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may be pretty certain that this writer's money-value in the market is considerably less than that of many another whose genius is not half so great, but his popularity twice as large. So that a failure to hit the popular taste does not always imply failure in Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, is one to know, when people do not ask for his work, if he has really failed or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he must know without being told if he has failed to please. If a man sings a song he can tell in a moment, even before he has finished, if he has pleased his audience. So, if a man writes a novel, he can tell by the criticisms in the journals, by reading between the lines of what his friends tell him, by the expression of their eyes, by his own inner consciousness, if he has succeeded or failed. And if the latter, let him find out as quickly as may be through what causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unlucky dramatist can complain that his piece was badly mounted and badly acted. The novelist cannot, because he is sure not to be badly read. Therefore, if a novelist fail at first, let him be well assured that it is his own fault; and if, on his second attempt, he cannot amend, let himfor the future be silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is more and more astonished at seeing the repeated efforts of writers whose friends should make them understand that they have not the least chance of success unless they unlearn all that they have learned and begin again upon entirely different methods and some knowledge of the science. It must be a cruel blow, after all the work that goes to make even a bad novel, after all the trouble of getting it published, to see it drop unnoticed, stillborn, though hardly worthy to receive words of contempt. If the disappointment leads to examination and self-amendment, it may prove the greatest blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he who fails twice probably deserves to fail, because he has learned nothing, and is incapable of learning anything, from the lessons of his first failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-present-condition-of-the-art-of-fiction-in-england&quot;&gt;The Present Condition of the Art of Fiction in England&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say one word upon the present condition of this most delightful Art in England. Remember that great Masters in every Art are rare. Perhaps one or two appear in a century; we ought not to expect more. It may even happen that those modern writers of our own whom we have agreed to call great Masters will have to take lower rank among posterity, who will have great Masters of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am inclined, however, to think that a few of the nineteenth-century novelists will never be suffered to die, though they may be remembered principally for one book — that Thackeray will be remembered for his &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Dickens for &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; George Meredith for the&quot;Ordeal of Richard Feverel,&quot; George Eliot for &quot;Silas Marner,&quot; Charles Reade for the &quot;Cloister and the Hearth,&quot; and Blackmore for his &quot;Lorna Doone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, without thinking or troubling ourselves at all about the verdict of posterity, which matters nothing to us compared with the verdict of our contemporaries, let us acknowledge that it is a bad year indeed when we have not produced some good work, work of a very high kind, if not immortal work. An exhibition of the year's novels would generally show two or three, at least, of which the country may be, say, reasonably proud. Does the Royal Academy of Arts show every year more than two or three pictures — not immortal pictures, but pictures of which we may be reasonably proud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would like, it is true, to see fewer bad novels published, as well as fewer bad pictures exhibited; the standard of the work which is on the borderland between success and failure should be higher. At the same time I am very sure and certain that there never has been a time when better works of Fiction have been produced, both by men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Art is not declining, but is advancing, which is cultivated on true and not on false or conventional principles. Ought we not to be full of hope for the future, when such women as Mrs. Oliphant and Mrs. Thackeray Ritchie write for us — when such men as Meredith, Blackmore, Black, Payn, Wilkie Collins, and Hardy are still at their best, and such men at Louis Stevenson, Christie Murray,Clark Russell, and Herman Merivale have just begun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the fiction, and, indeed, all the imaginary work of the future will he far fuller in human interest than in the past; the old stories — no doubt they will still be the old stories — will be fitted to actors who up till recently were only used for the purposes of contrast; the drama of life which formerly was assigned to kings and princes will be played by figures taken as much from the great struggling, unknown masses. Kings and great lords are chiefly picturesque and interesting on account of their beautiful costumes, and a traditional belief in their power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costume is certainly not a strong point in the lower ranks, but I think we shall not miss that, and wherever we go for our material, whether to the higher or the lower ranks, we may be sure of finding everywhere love, sacrifice, and devotion for virtues, with selfishness, cunning, and treachery for vices. Out of these, with their endless combinations and changes, that novelist must be poor indeed who cannot make a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I said at the outset that I would ask you to accord to novelists the recognition of their place as artists. But after what has been said, I feel that to urge this further would be only a repetition of what has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, though not all who write novels can reach the first, or even the second, rank, wherever you find good and faithful work, with truth, sympathy, and clearness of purpose, I pray you to give the author of that work thepraise as to an Artist — an Artist like the rest — the praise that you so readily accord to the earnest student of any other Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the great Masters of the Art — Fielding, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Victor Hugo — I, for one, feel irritated when the critics begin to appraise, compare, and to estimate them. There is nothing, I think, that we can give them but admiration that is unspeakable, and gratitude that is silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This silence proves more eloquently than any words how great, how beautiful an Art is that of Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been asked not to leave the young novelist at this point. Let me, therefore, venture upon a few words of advice. I do this without apology, because, like most men who write, I receive, every week, letters from young beginners asking for counsel and guidance. To all these I recommend the consideration of the rules I have laid down, and, above all, attention to truth, reality, and style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once asked to read a manuscript novel written by a young lady. The work was hurried, scamped, unreal — in fact, it had every fault. Yet there was something in it which made me think that there was hope for her. I therefore wrote to her, pointing out the faults, without sparing her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added that, if she was not discouraged, but would begin again, and would prepare carefully the scenario of a novel, fitted with characters duly thought out, I would give her such further advice as was in my power. The very next day she sent me five scenarios. I have not heard from her since, and I hope she has renounced the Art whose very elements she could not understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me suppose, then, that the writer has got his novel completed. Here begins the &quot; trouble,&quot; as the Americans say. And at this point my advicce may be of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that all publishers are eager to get good work: they are prepared to consider manuscripts carefully — most of them pay men, on whose judgment they rely, men of literary standing, to read and &quot;taste&quot; for them; therefore it is a simple and obvious piece of advice that the writer should send his work to some good publisher, and it is perfectly certain that if the work is good it will be accepted and published. There is, as I have said in the lecture, little or no risk, even with an unknown author, over a really good novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, then, the first work almost always contains immaturities and errors which prevent it from being really good. More often than not, it is on the border line, not so good as to make its publication desirable by a firm which will only issue good work, or by any means safe to pay its expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then? I would advise the author never, from any considerations of vanity or self-confidence, to pay money to a publisher for bringing out his book. There are certain publishing houses, not the best, which bring out yearly quantities of novels, nearly every one of which is paid for by the author, because they are not good enough to pay their own expenses. Do not, I would say, swell the ranks of those who give the enemy reason to blaspheme this Art. Refuse absolutely to publish on such ignominious terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that to be asked for money to pay for the expense of publication is to be told that your work is not good enough to be published. If you have tried the half-dozen best publishers, and been refused by all, realize that the work will not do. Then, if you can, get the advice of some experienced man of letters upon it, and ponder over his judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot, reconsider the whole story from the beginning, with special reference to the rules which are here laid down. If necessary, rewrite the whole. Or, if necessary, put the whole into the fire, and, without being disheartened, begin again with another and a better story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not aim at producing an absolutely new plot. You cannot do it. But persevere, if you feel that the root of the matter is in you, till your work is accepted; and never, never, NEVER pay for publishing a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me end with a little piece of personal history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good many years ago, there was a young man of four or five and twenty, who ardently desired before all things to become a novelist. He spent a couple of years, giving to the work all his unemployed hours, over a novel of modern life. He took immense pains with it, rewrote some of the scenes half a dozen times, and spared neither labor nor thought to make it as good as he could make it. When he really felt that he could do nothing more with it, he rolled it up and sent it to a friend with the request that he would place it anonymously in Mr. Macmillan's hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macmillan had it carefully read, and sent the author, still through the friend, his reader's opinion. The reader did not sign his opinion, but he was a Cambridge man, a critic of judgment, a man of taste, a kindly man, and he had once been, if he was not still, a mathematician. These things were clearly evident from his handwriting, as well as from the wording of his verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was to the effect that the novel should not be published, for certain reasons which he proceeded to give. But he laid down his objections with very great consideration for the writer, indicating for his encouragement what he considered points of promise, suggesting certain practical rules of construction which had been violated, and showing where ignorance of the Art and inexperience of life had caused faults such as to make it most undesirable for the author, as well as impossible for a publisher of standing, to produce the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer, after the first pangs of disappointment, plucked up heart and began to ponder over the lessons contained in that opinion. The young man has since become a novelist, &quot;of a sort,&quot; and he takes this opportunity of returning his most sincere thanks to Mr. Macmillan for his kindness in considering and refusing to publish an immature novel, and to his anonymous critic for his invaluable letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would that all publishers' readers were like unto that reader, as conscientious and as kindly, and as anxious to save beginners from putting forth bad work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;principles-of-writing-detective-tales&quot;&gt;Principles of Writing Detective Tales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a well-known fact that people who have never succeeded in anything end by writing books about how to succeed; and I do not see why the principle should not be applied to success in the writing of detective tales as well as in lower and less glorious walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before offering any criticism in the matter of mystery stories, I think it only fair to confess that I have myself written some of the worst mystery stories in the world. But, if I have achieved the lowest results, I might very well claim to have had the loftiest motive, for I acted on the divine principle of the Golden Rule. I did unto others as I would they would do unto me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I provided them with more stories about crime, in the faint hope that they in turn might provide me with more stories about crime. I cast my mystery on the waters, so to speak, hoping it might return to me after many days, with a totally different title and a much better tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the detective novel the division of labour is sharply drawn between the reader and the novelist. Perhaps it may be pointedly answered that the heavier part of the labour falls on the reader. Perhaps it is true, especially in those melancholy examples to which I have darkly referred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, anyhow, such a division does exist in the very nature of the detective story. If you write it, you cannot read it. If you want to read, it you must not be so ill-advised as to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that I cannot be thunderstruck at the end with a revelation which I have planned from the very beginning; nor can I be bewildered and inquisitive about the concealment of something which I am myself labouring to conceal. I cannot myself stagger with astonishment on learning that the Bishop has been a brigand, if I have myself elaborately disguised the brigand as a Bishop. The poet can sing his song, but the sensational writer cannot be shocked at his shocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I am moved to dogmatise about detective stories, partly because I see everywhere the advertisements of the dramatic version of one of the best of detective stories, &quot;The Yellow Room,&quot; and partly because I have just read again that excellent French story in its original form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not seen the play itself, but I hear it is a great success, though it by no means follows, from the nature of the problem, that a good mystery story will make a good play. Indeed, the two things in the abstract are almost antagonistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two methods of concealment are exactly contrary, for the drama depends on what was called the Greek irony – that is, on the knowledge of the audience, and not ignorance of the audience. In the detective story it is the hero (or villain) who knows, and the outsider who is deceived. In the drama it is the outsider (or spectator) who knows, and the hero who is deceived. The one keeps a secret from the actors, and the other from the audience. Nevertheless, the thing has been done successfully in one or two cases, and very probably in this case also. But the re-reading of the story itself, as well as of any amount of inferior stories of the same kind, has moved me to throw out some general suggestions about the true principles of this popular form of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to speak in any superior fashion of the inferior stories. I am very fond of trash; I have read a great deal of it – I have also written a great deal of it. But even in this department there is trash and trash; and we might be more easily amused if our idlest entertainers understood how to amuse us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fallacies-about-the-nature-of-the-true-mystery-story&quot;&gt;Fallacies About the Nature of the True Mystery Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are certain fallacies about the nature of the true mystery story which I perceive to be common among the writers as well as the readers of it. But I should like it to be understood that it is in the comparatively proud and honourable character of a reader of such stories, and not in the lower and more servile capacity of a writer of them, that I venture to indicate such errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is evidently a very general idea that the object of the detective novelist is to baffle the reader. Now, nothing is easier than baffling the reader, in the sense of disappointing the reader. There are many successful and widely advertised stories of which the principle simply consists in thwarting information by means of incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bulgarian governess is just about to mention her real reason for concealing herself with a loaded rifle inside the grand piano, when a yellow Chinaman leaps through the window and cuts off her head with a yataghan; [A yataghan is a Turkish scimitar with a double curved blade.] and this trivial interruption is allowed to defer the elucidation of the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is quite a simple matter to fill several volumes with adventures of this thrilling kind, without permitting the reader to advance a step in the direction of discovery. This is illegitimate, on the fundamental principles of this form of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not merely that it is not artistic, or that it is not logical. It is that it is not really exciting. People cannot be excited except about something; and at this stage of ignorance the reader has nothing to be excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are thrilled by knowing something, and on this principle they know nothing. The true object of an intelligent detective story is not to baffle the reader, but to enlighten the reader; but to enlighten him in such a manner that each successive portion of the truth comes as a surprise. In this, as in much nobler types of mystery, the object of the true mystic is not merely to mystify, but to illuminate. The object is not darkness, but light; but light in the form of lightning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-common-error-of-characters-in-detective-stories&quot;&gt;The Common Error of Characters in Detective Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the common error of making all the human characters sticks, or stock figures – not so much because the novelist is not intelligent enough to describe real characters as because he really thinks real characterization wasted on an unreal type of literature. In other words, he does the one thing which is destructive in every department of existence – he despises the work he is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the method is fatal to his mechanical object, even considered as a mechanical object. We cannot even be adequately thrilled by a whole secret society of assassins who have sworn to effect the death of a bore who is obviously better dead. And even in order that the novelist should kill people, it is first necessary that he should make them live. As a matter of fact, we may very well add the general principle that the most intense interest of a good mystery story does not consist in incident at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sherlock Holmes stories are very good working models of a workmanlike type of popular mystery. And the point of such a story is very seldom the story at all. The best part of it is the comedy of the conversations between Holmes and Watson; and that for the sound psychological reason that they are characters always, even when they are not actors at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I venture on this rebuke to the popular novelist, I must balance it by a similar and yet more solemn rebuke to the psychological novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensational story-teller does indeed create uninteresting characters, and then try to make them interesting by killing them. But the intellectual novelist yet more sadly wastes his talents, for he creates interesting characters, and then does not kill them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I complain of in the advanced and analytical artist in fiction is that he describes some subtle character, full of modern moods and doubts; that he expends all his imagination on realising every fine shade of the sentiment and philosophy of the sceptic or the free lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, when the hero in question is at last alive and ready to be murdered, when he is in every detail of his character demanding and requiring, and, as it were, crying aloud to be murdered, the novelist does not murder him after all. This is a serious waste of a fine opportunity, and I hope in future to see the error rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hunt-for-mystery&quot;&gt;The Hunt for Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original inventor of the legend of how a man sold himself to the Prince of Darkness, taking for his share of the bargain renewed youth and unbounded riches, certainly deserves to be awarded the palm for the most wondrous and mysterious plot that ever emanated from the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He must have been a deep thinker, one well versed in the philosophy of goose quill, knowing that his story would thrill the reader, and that he had achieved the great point of seizing upon that reader's imagination, and holding it, so that he would follow the mystery of the fiction to the very end. It may have been the result of some haphazard lucky thought, but still he must have been a careful student of every- day life, and must have duly noted how largely curiosity or the desire to fathom the unknown is developed in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible even to descend lower in the scale of creation and to find this quality in creatures which progress on four hands or four feet, and to note how frequently the hunter lures the unfortunate quarry to death by holding forth something novel to its gaze. But, setting aside the beast of the field, it is sufficient to recall how very soon in infant life a pair of little wondering eyes begin, in the nurse's parlance, &quot;to take notice,&quot; and how, before long, the use of the curious eyes is supplemented by a tiny, outstretched, feeling hand, trying to touch that something before it which is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child grows, and with its growth the desire increases, and, to speak broadly, becomes an insatiable desire to know what is on the other side of the wall that he cannot climb. In his simplicity he is the Simon of nursery lore, who cut open his mother's bellows to see whence came the wind. A much-maligned youth, by the way; for his simplicity was only the natural thirst for knowledge of a mystery; and, after all, he was somewhat of a philosopher studying pneumatics, and possibly wiser than his judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ordinary Simon of every-day life matures and becomes versed in his many studies, we find him still seeking after the meanings of the many mysteries of life, and dabbling in science as chemist, or as astronomer, puzzling out the why and wherefore of the worlds around; perhaps even turning to occultism as an earnest student, or as a victim of the charlatan; and, above all, sooner or later, trying to dive into the mysteries of the great unknown—the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this strong passion to know the unknown that is seized upon by the writer of a certain class of fiction, who realizing the vastness of his audience, and calculating his probabilities in prizes to be won in the shape of notoriety, publisher's smiles, and their consequences, throws over his natural desires to follow out the so-called higher paths of literature with the delineation and analysis of character, and in the first pages of his work seeks to start his reader off upon the hunt after a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaire is prepared, the scent is there, and the hunt for the elucidation begins. If cleverely arranged the hunter grows warmer and more breathless chapter by chapter, and at this rate he would soon run the mystery down; but he is carried off on false leads, disappointed, sent back to the true, and goes on with repetitions of the trick of which he is delightfully ignorant, till the last chapter is near, the quarry—the mystery—almost in sight, and finally, after a breathless chase, the aim of writer and reader is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hidden-in-fiction-literary-devices-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Hidden in Fiction: Literary Devices in Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going back to the most ancient utilizers of the hidden in fiction, it is a far-enough cry from the &lt;em&gt;Mysteries of Udolpho&lt;/em&gt;, to the &lt;em&gt;Mysteries of a Hansom Cab&lt;/em&gt;; from secret passage, dark dungeon, and strange appearances, to murder most foul and unnatural. Between those two points how innumerable have been the devices adopted to catch the reader's attention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goodly list of literary devices might be catalogued from the thousands of stories poured forth from the press, and it is food for the student to watch the hold they take upon the ordinary—even upon the extraordinary—reader, who is easily attracted to the mystery chase if that mystery be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be dressed with a curdling thrill like that of De Montepin, who starts his readers upon the trail of a horror in the cemetery of Père la Chaise, with the strange and gruesome idea suggestive of the natural, supernatural, and always of the ghastly—the discovery of a thin stream of blood issuing from beneath the stony door of one of the more pretentions tombs; or one of the ingenious complications full of the detective element contrived by Gaboriau or Boisgobey; or the mystery of a higher class arranged with its masterly sexual attractions, of the personage prisoned in the gloomy mansion who startled governess &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt; with her nightly shrieks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, who amongst us was not fascinated by the fortunes of the beautiful bigamist whose first husband so mysteriously disappeared, and who did not long to penetrate &lt;em&gt;Lady Audley's Secret&lt;/em&gt;, even feeling ready to forgive its rather vapid ending for the sake of the enjoyment experienced while under the clever novelist's spell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have the well-used, never-failing mystery followed as intently in real life as in fiction, the unravelling of that poisoning case which, once begun, has a perfect magnetism for the reader, whose stimulated mind goads him or her on in the chase with piquant questions. For there is first the sufferer dying by inches from that unknown fell disease which baffles all the physicians' skill—that is, the fiction physicians—for they remain chapters long in utter ignorance of the mysterious ailment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the discovery: it is produced by poison. But what poison? The symptoms are new to science. No deadly drug in the pharmacopoeia would produce these effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could it have been administered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By what means?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestions are many— so many little mysteries to make one big—and when it is settled that the victim is being slowly poisoned, comes the leading up to the questions of who could be the administrator, and for what reason is the unfortunate being gradually done to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is plenty of choice for the writer to gratify his reader: love, hatred, revenge, rivalry, hard cash, or, strongest of all—very telling this—for psychical reasons, to see a victim die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery is a strong card in the novelist's hand. By few has it been played with a skill like that of Wilkie Collins, who, with little characterization or sentiment, without creating individuals of fiction whom we remember, or whose sayings we quote, could hold the attention of the novel-reading world with his &lt;em&gt;Woman in White&lt;/em&gt;, or set them eagerly agog to find the whereabouts of the mysterious diamond taken from its Eastern sanctuary. For ingenuity of construction, blind leads, bafflings, and sustained interest &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt; stands high in the catalogue of the mysteries of fiction; and the reader was penetrating to a degree who fastened upon Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite the theft, the point being most graphically and tragically revealed in the scene in the East End where he lay a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not great, perhaps, this art of mystery in fiction, partaking as it does of the nature of a puzzle or conundrum; still it is ingenious though stagy, with its designing and fitting, and surely to be commended as an art worthy of a need of praise. Especially now that we have reached in reading a period when we are going through a transition stage which to the thoughtful is most marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novels of a century or so back were manly but coarse, and many a clever work retains its place on the bookshelves on account of its being licensed in its licentiousness by the brand, or hall mark, &quot;classic.&quot; Then, as refinement obtained, we went through a phase of the morbidly sentimental, followed up by the sentimental romantic, which gave place in turn to productions of sterling worth lasting up to and continued in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mystery-novels-of-france&quot;&gt;Mystery Novels of France&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In company with all these, of course, there were the importations from across the Channel—clever, unprincipled, immoral, often filthy to a degree. In these, for the most part, the art of mystery was wanting. There was no room for it. The text was in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred sexuality. These had their readers naturally enough, but the hot-blooded exotic novel was neither popular nor plentiful. Now we have changed all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another French fashion has been imported; it has obtained its hold upon a largely increasing &lt;em&gt;clientèle&lt;/em&gt; of readers, and is dubbed the gospel of nature. By them the honest, straightforward is pooh-poohed; Scott is a bore, Dickens burlesque, Thackeray tiresome satire, George Eliot old-fashioned and dull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French novel, in short, a score or so of years ago, was read and not named; now it is read, and not only named but is answerable for a new school of novelists who base themselves upon their French masters and imitate them as nearly as they dare for there are reasons—patent reasons—not unconnected with circulation, which hinder the modern Gallicised writer from going as far as he probably would. We have held up to us as master-pieces of nature and realism, &lt;em&gt;Manon Lescaut&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Madame Bovary&lt;/em&gt;, and the sham philosophic but mighty efforts of a great brain/ the works of Zola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One casts no slur upon the ability of the writers of these romances. They are Frenchmen, of France, and their ways are not ours. But the insidious work is going on and is having its effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally our writers are ruled by the demand. The success of one brings forth many imitators, and the result is that many of the books now published, notably those written by the so-called weaker sex, grow broader and stronger—certainly in more senses than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school of writers to whom we owe this advance, this imitative effort in letters, scorning the art of mystery in fiction, claim for their work that it is in its breadth and strength more masculine—they might add feminine, though the reader may wade through many a novel without finding a true woman—nothing but the animal feminine whom the Frank delights to portray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence is daily growing, and an example of its effects is plainly before us—an example almost ludicrous—for we find one of our principal newspapers giving its assurance (in answer to certain rumors) that the novel appearing in its columns has not been expurgated, but is exactly as it came from the novelist's pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sensationalism-in-the-mystery&quot;&gt;Sensationalism in the Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might expect that with the advance of this class of narrative with naturalism so strongly to the fore, the old school of sensationalism would be beaten out of the field, but though the new writer basing his fiction upon his French master may out-Herod Herod and cause a massacre among the innocents he contemns, the mystery-lover will never be convinced, but will seek after his favorite food with as great a zest as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing repellent here; the natural desire to penetrate the occult is evoked, and in this lies the power which has won for many a work utterly wanting in truth to nature, plausibility and literary style—a work in fact of the most crude and rugged type—a fabulous circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be invidious to name such books, to pose as a judge, and give what at best would be only one opinion, but the question must have been asked by many a reader how it was that such farragoes of impossibilities—such tragi-burlesque played by abortive imitations of human life—could have enthralled their hundreds of thousands, and kept their attention from the beginning to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. It is the mystery of the story and the curiosity excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have a peculiar charm for most readers—most, for a tale of this kind with an ingenious, well-constructed plot partakes somewhat of the nature of the fabled Maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-popular-sensation-story&quot;&gt;The Popular Sensation Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the lover of the vapid style of society novel, or of those dealing with afternoon calls and tea, liberally amalgamated with upholstery and the latest fashions; the lady worshipper of the athletic giants who crush the gentle violets of society and break hearts because it is their nature to, and consequently go on macadamizing their life path with these brittle objects so liberally offered to them—in novels; the patron of the libraries who is content with nothing less than character-studies, analysis of life, struggles against temptation, sexual or religious infidelity, stories of pure-minded church dignitaries fighting against doubt, or Barham's worst devil of all—the &quot; laughing woman with two bright eyes,&quot; and who go through three volumes representing in Book I. the flitting fly, in Book II. the contact with the web and the vain struggles, and in Book III. the rescue and cleansing of the tangled wings by faith, fighting or death; all these readers fall at times to the ordinary mystery in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their nature is too strong for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover of the popular-sensation story is lifted with possibly a smile of contempt for the people who can &quot;devour such stuff,&quot; and of course just to skim a few pages to see what it may be like. Or it may he by accident, for want of something better to hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a few lines are read, and could the ingenious writer be looking on, and always supposing that in cleverness of construction and freshness of idea the story is one of the best of its class, he too could have his smile for the great-browed deep thinker and student of the higher questions and theories of the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the reader has placed one foot in the literary whirlpool, the other follows, and in the vast majority of cases complete immersion ensues; he starts on his career round and round, lost to everything but the insidious curiosity-exciting plot of the book, till the brain hunger is excited, and with the desire thoroughly piqued, he reads on to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the book is thrown down—possibly with a contemptuous, &quot;What trash!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One joins issue here. Is it such trash when it has been so constructed and so written that it has kept the reader's brain spellbound, held the attention not only for the time occupied in reading three ordinary library volumes, but often in a tantalized state from month to month—six, or even twelve—when the work has appeared in periodical or magazine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These effects are produced by a combination of nature and art; nature worked upon by art most artfully; but it is given to few—this power of piquing a reader's brain. Once touched, though, the novelist has a wonderful ally in his victim, who colors up the pictures, and represents them to his mind's eye to suit his own taste, and often renders that which is dull bright in the extreme—to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-young-reader-to-the-mysterious-bones&quot;&gt;The Young Reader to the Mysterious Bones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might exemplify how strongly this is the case in many of the stories of adventure that have been written for boys, which, so to speak, have been merely skeletons—hard, dry bones, but well set up, strong, and perfectly articulated. Every joint has been carefully placed, and the form is without a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the young reader to the mysterious bones, eager and full of curiosity. His vivid young imagination begins to work, and in a very short time that skeleton is clothed by him—not by the author—with elastic tendon, vigorous muscle, and a color of which the writer has hardly dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skeleton is alive and full of action, while the scene in which it begins to move and have its being impresses itself so upon the soft wax of the youthful imagination that it lasts there unabraded by a life of toil and care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, though in a less degree, the adult reader, albeit his or her brain is a little thicker in its &lt;em&gt;pia&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;dura mater&lt;/em&gt;, and more difficult to impress, also helps the author in his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-natural-desire-for-the-weird-and-wonderful&quot;&gt;The Natural Desire for the Weird and Wonderful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One who has studied these questions from many points of view, and, above all, noted how a story will &quot;catch on,&quot; and almost electrically seize the imagination of the reading world, will constantly see that in the majority of cases the most popular fiction of the day is that in which mystery plays a prominent part—a mystery which is well concealed. It is no secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There as aforesaid is the natural desire for the weird and wonderful—that hunger for the knowledge of the unknown which began with the forbidden apple; and the practiser of the art in question merely grows for those who hunger a fruit that is goodly to the eye, agreeable to the taste, and one that if he—or she—be worthy of the honored name of author, should only contain in its seeds a sufficiency of hydrocyanic poison to make it piquant in its savor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no forbidden fruit that he should offer, only an apple that is hard to pick, now within the grasp, now hidden amongst the leaves of the bright garden in which the reader is lured to stray, and rest and refresh, away from life's marking care—a fruit whose first bite excites fresh desire, whose taste brings forth an intense longing for more, and of which the choicest and most enticing morsel is cleverly held back to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-artistic-merit-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Artistic Merit of the Detective Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attempting to reach the genuine psychological reason for the popularity of detective stories, it is necessary to rid ourselves of many mere phrases. It is not true, for example, that the populace prefer bad literature to good, and accept detective stories because they are bad literature. The mere absence of artistic subtlety does not make a book popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bradshaw's Railway Guide contains few gleams of psychological comedy, yet it is not read aloud uproariously on winter evenings. If detective stories are read with more exuberance than railway guides, it is certainly because they are more artistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many good books have fortunately been popular; many bad books, still more fortunately, have been unpopular. A good detective story would probably be even more popular than a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble in this matter is that many people do not realize that there is such a thing as a good detective story; it is to them like speaking of a good devil. To write a story about a burglary is, in their eyes, a sort of spiritual manner of committing it. To persons of somewhat weak sensibility this is natural enough; it must be confessed that many detective stories are as full of sensational crime as one of Shakespeare's plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, between a good detective story and a bad detective story as much, or, rather more, difference than there is between a good epic and a bad one. Not only is a detective story a perfectly legitimate form of art, but it has certain definite and real advantages as an agent of the public weal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-essential-value-of-the-detective-story-the-poetry-of-modern-life&quot;&gt;The Essential Value of the Detective Story: The Poetry of Modern Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first essential value of the detective story lies in this, that it is the earliest and only form of popular literature in which is expressed some sense of the poetry of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men lived among mighty mountains and eternal forests for ages before they realized that they were poetical; it may reasonably be inferred that some of our descendants may see the chimney-pots as rich a purple as the mountain-peaks, and find the lamp-posts as old and natural as the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of this realization of a great city itself as something wild and obvious the detective story is certainly the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt;. No one can have failed to notice that in these stories the hero or the investigator crosses London with something of the loneliness and liberty of a prince in a tale of elfland, that in the course of that incalculable journey the casual omnibus assumes the primal colours of a fairy ship. The lights of the city begin to glow like innumerable goblin eyes, since they are the guardians of some secret, however crude, which the writer knows and the reader does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every twist of the road is like a finger pointing to it; every fantastic skyline of chimney-pots seems wildly and derisively signalling the meaning of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization of the poetry of London is not a small thing. A city is, properly speaking, more poetic even than a countryside, for while Nature is a chaos of unconscious forces, a city is a chaos of conscious ones. The crest of the flower or the pattern of the lichen may or may not be significant symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is no stone in the street and no brick in the wall that is not actually a deliberate symbol – a message from some man, as much as if it were a telegram or a post-card. The narrowest street possesses, in every crook and twist of its intention, the soul of the man who built it, perhaps long in his grave. Every brick has as human a hieroglyph as if it were a graven brick of Babylon; every late on the roof is as educational a document as if it were a slate covered with addition and subtraction sums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything which tends, even under the fantastic form of the minutiae of Sherlock Holmes, to assert this romance of detail in civilization, to emphasize this unfathomably human character in flints and tiles, is a good thing. It is good that the average man should fall into the habit of looking imaginatively at ten men in the street even if it is only on the chance that the eleventh might be a notorious thief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may dream, perhaps, that it might be possible to have another and higher romance of London, that men's souls have stranger adventures than their bodies, and that it would be harder and more exciting to hunt their virtues than to hunt their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since our great authors (with the admirable exception of Stevenson) decline to write of that thrilling mood and moment when the eyes of the great city, like the eyes of a cat, begin to flame in the dark, we must give fair credit to the popular literature which, amid a babble of pedantry and preciosity, declines to regard the present as prosaic or the common as commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular art in all ages has been interested in contemporary manners and costume; it dressed the groups around the Crucifixion in the garb of Florentine gentlefolk or Flemish burghers. In the last century it was the custom for distinguished actors to present Macbeth in a powdered wig and ruffles. How far we are ourselves in this age from such conviction of the poetry of our own life and manners may easily be conceived by anyone who chooses to imagine a picture of Alfred the Great toasting the cakes dressed in tourist's knickerbockers, or a performance of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; in which the Prince appeared in a frock-coat, with a crepe band round his hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this instinct of the age to look back, like Lot's wife, could not go on forever. A rude, popular literature of the romantic possibilities of the modern city was bound to arise. It has arisen in the popular detective stories, as rough and refreshing as the ballads of Robin Hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, another good work that is done by detective stories. While it is the constant tendency of the Old Adam to rebel against so universal and automatic a thing as civilization, to preach departure and rebellion, the romance of police activity keeps in some sense before the mind the fact that civilization itself is the most sensational of departures and the most romantic of rebellions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;detectives-in-fiction-are-the-unsleeping-sentinels-who-guard-the-outposts-of-society&quot;&gt;Detectives in Fiction Are the Unsleeping Sentinels Who Guard the Outposts of Society&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By dealing with the unsleeping sentinels who guard the outposts of society, it tends to remind us that we live in an armed camp, making war with a chaotic world, and that the criminals, the children of chaos, are nothing but the traitors within our gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the detective in a police romance stands alone, and somewhat fatuously fearless amid the knives and fists of a thieves' kitchen, it does certainly serve to make us remember that it is the agent of social justice who is the original and poetic figure; while the burglars and footpads are merely placid old cosmic conservatives, happy in the immemorial respectability of apes and wolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The romance of the police force is thus the whole romance of man. It is based on the fact that morality is the most dark and daring of conspiracies. It reminds us that the whole noiseless and unnoticeable police management by which we are ruled and protected is only a successful knight-errantry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Motive</title>
        <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having decided upon our characters, our crime, and our weapon, let us consider next the motive for the crime. Of course in all crimes except murder, the motive is obvious; for who would commit a robbery except to obtain the booty? Who would commit arson except with the intent of destroying property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a murder story the motive is one of the principal parts of the mystery. It has been said that there are only three motives for murder: money, love and revenge. While this is true in a general way, there are many other specific motives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Train's book, &quot;Courts, Criminals and the Camorra,&quot; there is a most interesting chapter devoted to this question of motive. Though it is impossible to quote it all, we will refer to his published record compiled by a man who had been trying murder cases for ten years. Several pages tell the details of the record, but a concise summing up is also given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are told, &quot;Out of the sixty-two homicides recorded, there were seventeen cold-blooded murders, with deliberation and premeditation; three homicides due to negligence; five committed while perpetrating a felony; thirty-seven manslaughters, due in sixteen cases to quarrels, thirteen to drink, four to disputes over money, three to women, one to race antagonism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further classification is given, and the whole chapter, indeed, the whole book, should be read by every writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a small percentage, however, of recorded murders are adaptable to fiction plots. A study of the causes of real murders is useful, if one has discrimination in choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motive in fiction must be picturesque if possible, and interesting in any case. We care little what ruffian murdered another in a back alley; but we are intensely curious to know who killed Mr. Leavenworth or the Widow Lerouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting motives are doubtless money, love and revenge; but the ramifications of these include hate, jealousy, greed, safety, ambition, inheritance and many others—in fact, the whole category of human emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally there is what might be called a freakish motive, such as the homicidal mania of &quot;The Whispering Man&quot;; or the curious motive of the criminal in the &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are sporadic instances. The soundest motives are the best, and in most cases the soundest are the simplest. Murder is the result of one of the most primitive impulses in man; and though the working out of the plot may be subtle, it is wise, so far as is possible, to have the motive simple, straightforward and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If consistent with the plot, let the motive be of recent date. It is annoying to discover at the end of the book that the motive is retaliation for a wrong done thirty or forty years ago, as in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; or &quot;Hand and Ring.&quot; These, otherwise perfect and really great detective stories, finally reveal motives which could not possibly be discovered by the reader, however much he might guess at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the motive be as carefully concealed as you like, but offer adroit hints and veiled allusions that the astute reader may catch if he can, and when at last the motive is revealed, let it be a logical and sound one, and, above all, let it be adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Handling of the Crime</title>
        <description>&lt;section id=&quot;toc&quot; class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h6&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;drawer&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of the murder is a point to be carefully chosen and this consideration of course includes the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shooting is perhaps the means most often used, with stabbing as a close second. If a shooting, the weapon is usually a revolver, or occasionally a rifle. In this case, care must be taken that the scene is out of doors; or, if indoors, in an isolated apartment or so placed that the report shall be out of hearing of the other characters, unless immediate discovery is intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various devices are used to keep the innocent characters from hearing the shooting. In one case only a half-charge of powder was put into a gun. In another, of recent date, a silent bullet was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong point is always made of the evidence of the weapon, if it be found. But, as we have before hinted, do not persist in having the revolver marked with the initials of a perfectly innocent person, for this has come to be looked upon as a tacit acquittal. It is hackneyed, also, to have the pistol one of a pair, and trace it by means of its duplicate still reposing in its case in the criminal's library. Learn to avoid these over-worked devices, as there are surely plenty of others. If a pistol is your chosen weapon, treat it either inconspicuously, or in some novel and original fashion that will interest the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a stabbing is principally that the weapon may be picked up at the moment, in a sudden impulse to kill; while a pistol usually implies a premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weapon picked up on the spot has the advantage of not necessitating its concealment after use, for it incriminates no one in particular. Oftenest this weapon is a dagger used as a paper cutter, and so lying at hand on a table. Or a dagger or sword which is one of a decorative group on the wall of the room. Another weapon which has crept into use of late y ears is the hatpin. This, though popular among writers, is implausible and in many cases impossible; for the average hatpin bends but does not break. Yet one author after another kills his victim by stabbing him with a hatpin which breaks off and disappears in the wound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would-be clever author caused his victim to fall violently forward (with his mouth conveniently open), and allow a hatpin held by a near-by lady to strike through the roof of his mouth and pierce his brain. The obliging hatpin broke off at just the right place, and as the lady concealed the head end, the point end of the fatal weapon was never discovered. This related incident is practically impossible and should not have been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Spanish story called &quot;The Nail,&quot; by Pedro de Alargon, practically reverses this method. A large nail was driven into the victim's skull and accomplished its purpose immediately. The head of the nail was concealed by the man's thick hair, and all unsuspecting of villainy, three medical experts declared the man's death due to apoplexy. Nor were they entirely to blame, as the physical effects brought about by the nail were precisely the same as the conditions of death by apoplexy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nail is a horrible suggestion, but whatever weapon brings about violent death is necessarily horrible. It is wise to dwell on the physical details as little as possible. Granted a murder, there must be a method, and if the exigencies of the story demand a horrible method, so be it; but remember Poe's injunction, and when painting the decayed cheeses make them look as little like decayed cheeses as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poison is a method giving the author a wider scope and necessitating somewhat legs gruesome conditions. It is easier to administer poison than to shoot or stab. Poison may be given in food or drink, or introduced into medicine or administered in more ingenious and original ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this method is used, the author should study up on poisons and their effects, and not run the risk of making absurd mistakes in his text. Abstruse scientific information is not necessary; enough can be learned from an encyclopaedia or a medical dictionary; but the plausibilities must be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite poison with writers who know little of the subject, is &quot;a curious Indian or Persian drug, which acts instantaneously and leaves no trace.&quot; This drug, with its various and unintelligible names, has been somewhat over-worked; but it is acceptable because of its mystery and it is useful because its description is so vague as to need no real knowledge of it on the part of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of a poison murder implies more complexities than a death by shooting or stabbing. The poisoner is a person of more ingenuity and is more anxious to escape discovery; and it also gives scope for treachery and deceit. Then, too, it has the advantage of allowing the detail of bloodshed to be omitted, thus making the scene less ghastly to sensitive minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drowning and strangling and chloroforming eliminate also the necessity for bloodshed, and have the added advantage of requiring no especial weapon; though the presence of the weapon, or the absence of one known to have been used, is a valuable asset to the mystery writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the principal means of murder are enumerated above, the various manifestations of these means are innumerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambitious writer often strives to find some new and original way of committing a hackneyed crime. So far has this been carried, that the latest detective stories employ the use of cultures of typhoid or diphtheria to bring about the necessary demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such means are perfectly legitimate in detective fiction, and if detailed with accurate and correct scientific knowledge are convincing, though not picturesque. Sherlock Holmes, with his fancy for the bizarre, rarely is satisfied with a plain shooting or stabbing. He uses such means as a blunt weapon, pushing into the water, a venomous snake, a harpoon, a poker, charcoal fumes, and a fall from a steep precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Anna Katharine Green's best stories, &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; employs the homely weapon of a billet of fire-wood. We are told at the outset that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Half the criminals are caught because they do make tracks and then resort to such extraordinary means to cover them up. The true secret of success in this line lies in striking your blow with a weapon picked up on the spot, and in choosing for the scene of your tragedy a thoroughfare where, in the natural course of events, other men will come and go and unconsciously tread out your traces, provided you have made any. This dissipates suspicion, or starts it in so many directions that justice is at once confused, if not ultimately baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sound principle of construction, and is the starting point of many of the best detective stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; the author goes back to the primitive weapon of a mutton bone, and in the skillful hands of both author and criminal this weapon is truly dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An author's first plot almost invariably centers around a shooting or a stabbing affair. It is in his later efforts that he feels moved to vary his methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding crimes other than murder, we find that more depends on the setting. A robbery, however great the booty, must be made interesting by unusual characters or conditions, and must implicate the hero or other important characters to the danger point. The discovery of the wrong-doer must mean disgrace and disaster of the strongest sort. For your detective story fancier is an extremist; and, owing to the predominance of murder stories and capital punishment, a short imprisonment for a robbery seems tame by contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a robbery story, but it combines all the elements that make for a dramatic setting, and though not the main motive, it includes a murder, and also a suicide, incidentally in the plot. It is one of the very few full-sized novels built upon a robbery, and it required the peculiar genius of a Wilkie Collins to hold the reader's attention through its five hundred pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other crimes than those we have considered, such as forgery, arson, blackmail, etc., are used only by authors in search of a novelty. They fancy that these crimes will interest because they are not so hackneyed as murder and robbery. But unless worked up with great care as to atmosphere and technique, stories of these crimes often prove dull reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some authors incline to such subjects as Nihilism and the workings of secret societies. These are not of such general interest as the ones we have been discussing, but they offer picturesque possibilities and scope for melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance of the detective is always of interest and each author in turn endeavors to make his marvelous-minded creature look as physically unlike other fiction detectives as possible. And especially does he aim to have him totally different in his effects from the popular conception of the conventional detective. In fact the average detective of fiction is always declared to look absolutely unlike the average detective of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-early-detective-portraits&quot;&gt;Some Early Detective Portraits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Dupin is not described physically, as Poe's marvelous economy of attention made him omit every possible bit of material extraneous to his actual story. But, beginning let us say, with Lecoq, all seem to be diametrically opposed to the conventional detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from &quot;The Crime of Orcival&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq, whom none of them had ever met before, in no wise resembled the conventional French detective. The latter is commonly depicted as a tall fellow, with heavy moustaches and &quot;imperial,&quot; wearing a military stock collar, a greasy silk hat, and a threadbare frock-coat buttoned up to the throat so as to conceal either the complete absence of linen or at all events the extreme dirtiness of a calico shirt. Such an individual will have immense feet incaged in heavy Wellingtons and will carry in his right hand a powerful sword-stick or bludgeon. Now M. Lecoq, as he appeared in the diningroom at Valfeuillu, had nothing whatever in common with this familiar type. It is true, however, that he can assume whatever air he pleases. Although his friends declare that he has features of his own which he retains at home when sitting by his own fire-side, with his slippers on, this is by no means certain. At all events, his mobile face lends itself to strange transformations, and he modifies his features according to his will just as the sculptor moulds his modelling clay. He changes everything, even the expression of his eyes. On this occasion M. Lecoq had assumed a handsome wig of lank hair, neither fair nor dark, but rather pretentiously parted on one side. Whiskers of the same vague colour puffed out with bad pomade, encircled his pallid face. His eyelids were very red; his eyes seemed weak and watery, and an open smile rested on his thick lips, which, in parting, disclosed a range of long yellow teeth. Timidity, self-sufficiency, and contentment were equally blended in the expression of his features. No one would ever have credited the possessor of such a head with even average intelligence. He looked the picture of some dull-minded, money-grubbing haberdasher, who after cheating his customers for thirty years, had retired on a large income. His coat was like all other coats, his trousers like all other trousers. A hair-chain, of the same colour as his whiskers, spanned his stomach, and a large silver watch could be seen bulging out of his left waistcoat pocket. While he spoke he fumbled with a horn box full of tiny square lozenges, and adorned on the cover with the portrait of a homely well- dressed woman, &quot;the dear defunct,11 no doubt. As the conversation proceeded, according as he was satisfied or disturbed, M. Lecoq munched one of these lozenges or gave the portrait a glance which was quite a poem in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this was Lecoq in disguise. But the natural man, though seldom seen, was also unlike the regulation French detective. At his very first appearance on Gaboriau's pages he is described thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… he was about twenty-five years old, with a pale face, red lips and an abundance of curly black hair, but with scarcely a sign of beard or mustache. He was short but well-made, and his whole manner denoted energy of extraordinary character. With the exception of his eyes, there was nothing very remarkable in his appearance, but these either shone brilliantly or else grew dull, according to the disposition of the moment. His nose, which was rather wide, possessed an amount of flexibility that was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is old Father Tabaret, except on close inspection, apparently possessed of detective insight. Here is his picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a large, heavily curtained bed, covered up almost to the nose, lay the oracle of the Rue de Jerusalem. It was almost impossible to believe that such great intelligence could exist in that figure, the face of which showed nothing but the appearance of the greatest stupidity; a retreating forehead, huge ears, a little snub nose, small eyes, and thick lips, made M. Tabaret look more like a half-witted citizen than the sagacious citizen that he was. It is true that when he was closely examined there was something in him resembling a sleuth-hound, the habits and instincts of which he possessed to such a great extent. In the street the impudent young urchins would shout after him, &quot;Oh! what a guy,&quot; but he laughed at all this, and even took a pleasure in putting on an extra appearance of folly and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidocq, though not declared to be uncommon in his appearance, is sufficiently so to give him the necessary prestige. We are told that &quot;he was a strong, well-built man with square shoulders and shambling gait. He had gray hair, a thick nose, blue eyes, a smooth face and a perpetual smile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Vidocq really lived, yet his &quot;Memoirs&quot; are believed to be largely fiction, and so we may class him, in part at least, among our story-book friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins deliberately draws his picture of the official detective thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a family in our situation, the Superintendent of the Frizinghall police was the most comforting officer you could wish to see. Mr. Seegrave was tall and portly, and military in his manners. He had a fine, commanding voice, and a mighty resolute eye, and a grand frock coat which buttoned beautifully up to his leather stock. &quot;I'm the man you want,11 was written all over his face; and he ordered his two inferior policemen about with a severity which convinced us all that there was no trifling with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in every respect a vivid contrast, he gives us a picture of the engaging Sergeant Cuff, for after all, the beauty of a detective is largely in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the time came for the Sergeant's arrival I went down to the gate to look out for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A fly from the railway drove up as I reached the lodge; and out got a grizzled, elderly man, so miserably lean that he looked as if he had not got an ounce of flesh on his bones in any part of him. He was dressed all in decent black, with a white cravat round his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His face was as sharp as a hatchet, and the skin of it was as yellow and dry and withered as an autumn leaf. His eyes, of a steely light gray, had a disconcerting trick, when they encountered your eyes, of looking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself. His walk was soft; his voice was melancholy; his long, lanky fingers were hooked like claws. He might have been a parson, or an undertaker, or anything else you like, except what he really was. A more complete opposite to Superintendent Seegrave than Sergeant Cuff, and a less comforting officer to look at for a family in distress, I defy you to discover, search where you may.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-more-modern-portraits&quot;&gt;Some More Modern Portraits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes is too well known to the reading public to require description here, but a brief account of his appearance, as detailed by Watson, proves his unlikeness to those we have previously looked at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so exceedingly lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost ludicrous contrast to Holmes is a young detective who never achieved Sherlock's popularity, but whose wonderful instinct for pure reasoning puts him at the head of his own class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Rouletabille, who figures in &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His friend Sainclair, who is his Watsonian chronicler, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a &quot;permit to communicate&quot; for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, &quot;a good nut.&quot; He seemed to have taken his head—round as a bullet—out of a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of the press—all determined billiard-players—had given him that nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How, while still so young—he was only sixteen and a half years old when I saw him for the first time—had he already won his way on the press? That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked, if they had not known his history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, however, Rouletabille was not nominally the great detective of the book—that honor was given to Frederick Larsan—who seemed to show a few of Sherlock Holmes' physical characteristics. This is Larsan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair turning grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead was prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round, with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was of middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and gentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself. The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been taught by experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His strange profession had brought him into contact with so many crimes and villainies that it would have been remarkable if his nature had not been a little hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An interesting-looking detective is &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; of Jacques Futrelle. His description is written with Mr. Futrelle's individual touch, and Professor Van Dusen possesses the squint which Mr. Train regards as a detective's birthright:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Practically all those letters remaining in the alphabet after Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen was named, were afterward acquired by that gentleman in the course of a brilliant scientific career, and, being honorably acquired, were tacked on to the other end. His name, therefore, taken with all that belonged to it, was a wonderfully imposing structure. He was a Ph.D., an LL.D., an F.R.S. an M.D., and an M.D.S. He was also some other things—just what, he himself couldn't say—through recognition of his ability by various foreign educational and scientific institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In appearance he was no less striking than in nomenclature. He was slender, with the droop of the student in his thin shoulders and the pallor of a close, sedentary life on his clean-shaven face. His eyes wore a perpetual, forbidding squint—the squint of a man who studies little things—and when they could be seen at all through his thick spectacles, were mere slits of watery blue. But above his eyes was his most striking feature. This was a tall, broad brow, almost abnormal in height and width, crowned by a heavy shock of bushy, yellow hair. All these things conspired to give him a peculiar, almost grotesque personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is one of the very best constructors of a detective story. The first introduction of her Mr. Gryce begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And here let me say that Mr. Gryce, the detective, was not the thin, wiry individual with the piercing eye you are doubtless expecting to see. On the contrary, Mr. Gryce was a portly, comfortable personage with an eye that never pierced, that did not even rest on you. If it rested anywhere, it was always on some insignificant object in the vicinity, some vase, inkstand, book, or button. These things he would seem to take into his confidence, make the repositories of his conclusions; but as for you—you might as well be the steeple on Trinity Church, for all connection you ever appeared to have with him or his thoughts. At present, then, Mr. Gryce was, as I have already suggested, on intimate terms with the doorknob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a later book she again insists upon this unlikeness to what may be expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was therefore moving reluctantly away, when I felt a slight but peremptory touch on the arm, and turning, saw the detective a my side, still studying his piece of china.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was, as I have said, of portly build and benevolent aspect; a fatherly-looking man, and not at all the person one would be likely to associate with the police. Yet he could take the lead very naturally, and when he spoke, I felt bound to answer him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grodman, in &quot;Big Bow Mystery,&quot; is briefly described by Mr. Zangwill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After an age seven minutes by any honest clock—Grodman made his appearance, looking as dressed as usual, but with unkempt hair and with disconsolate side- whisker yet, for it had only recently come within the margin of cultivation. In active service Grodman had been clean-shaven, like all members of the profession—for surely your detective is the most versatile of actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the picture of Wimp the official detective in the same book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wimp was young and fresh-colored. He had a Roman nose, and was smartly dressed. He had beaten Grodman by discovering the wife Heaven meant for him. He had a bouncing boy, who stole jam out of the pantry without any one being the wiser. Wimp did what work he could do at home in a secluded study at the top of the house. Outside his chamber of horrors he was the ordinary husband of commerce. He adored his wife, who thought poorly of his intellect, but highly of his heart. In domestic difficulties Wimp was helpless. He could not even tell whether the servant's &quot;character&quot; was forged or genuine. Probably he could not level himself to such petty problems. He was like the senior wrangler who has forgotten how to do quadratics, and has to solve equations of the second degree by the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference to Wimp's wife is thus explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a moment the first floor window was raised—the little house was of the same pattern as her own—and Grodman's full, fleshy face loomed through the fog in sleepy irritation from under a nightcap. Despite its scowl the detective's face dawned upon her like the sun upon an occupant of the haunted chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What in the devil's the matter?&quot; he growled. Grodman was not an early bird, now that he had no worms to catch. He could afford to despise proverbs now, for the house in which he lived was his, and he lived in it because several other houses in the street were also his and it is well for the landlord to be about his own estate in Bow where poachers often shoot the moon. Perhaps the desire to enjoy his greatness among his early cronies counted for something, too, for he had been born and bred at Bow, receiving when a youth his first engagement from the local police quarters, whence he drew a few shillings a week as an amateur detective in his leisure hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grodman was still a bachelor. In the celestial matrimonial bureau a partner might have been selected for him, but he had never been able to discover her. It was his one failure as a detective. He was a self-sufficing person, who preferred a gas stove to a domestic; but in deference to Glover Street opinion he admitted a female factotum between ten a.m. and ten p.m., and, equally in deference to Glover Street opinion, excluded her between ten p.m. and ten a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-less-known-portraits&quot;&gt;Some Less Known Portraits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon Holmes inclines to Wilkie Collins' plan of contrasting the appearance of the real detective and the fictional at once. In &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance&quot; he presents these opposite physical effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inspector White, of Scotland Yard, was announced, and a short, thick-set man entered. He was absolutely round in every part. His sturdy, rotund frame was supported on stout, well-moulded legs. His bullet head, with close- cropped hair, gave a suggestion of strength to his rounded face, and a pair of small bright eyes looked suspiciously on the world from beneath well-arched eyebrows. Two personalities more dissimilar than those of Claude Bruce and Inspector White could hardly be brought together in the same room. People who are fond of tracing resemblances to animals in human beings would liken the one to a gray-hound, the other to a bull-dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet they were both masters in the art of detecting crime—the barrister subtle, analytic, introspective; the policeman direct, pertinacious, self-confident. Bruce lost all interest in a case when the hidden trail was laid bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. White regarded investigation as so many hours on duty until his man was transported or hanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; an astonishing detective story by Henry Kitchell Webster, we have this description of the detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was the sort of a man who never would be spoken of as old, if it were not for his attempts to look young. He was actually, I should judge, somewhere in the middle forties, a tall, graceful, and commanding figure, with a strikingly handsome face. There was nothing weak about it. The features were big and boldly, though finely, modeled, and the deep-set eyes singularly expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only fault one could find with him was that he carried everything just a little too far. He was too aggressively well dressed; too painfully clean-shaven; his manner a little too dignified; his voice and features a little too expressive. It came upon me all at once what he must be—an actor. That was it. Everything about him was heightened just enough to carry itself over the footlights. He was in evening dress, wore an overcoat and gloves, and carried a walking stick, as well as an irreproachable silk hat, in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Scales of Justice,&quot; an exceptionally clever surprise story by George L. Knapp, the Hero Detective is not a professional one, but a young newspaper reporter. He is therefore allowed the characteristics of our best newspaper men, but in all probability he inherits his sardonic humor from his predecessor Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kern tossed the shears into a drawer, and stood up. He was as tall as the other man, and as straight; and both had that alert look of expectancy, quite unmixed with either wonder or nervousness, which marks our best newspaper men. There the resemblance ended. Jennings was about thirty-five, smooth-shaven, smiling brown of hair and blue of eye; with humorous little wrinkles around the eyes to testify of the many funny things he had seen. Kern was twenty-eight or twenty-nine; and his coal-black hair and bronze-black Vandyke beard made him look more like an Austrian surgeon than an American reporter. His humor was apt to be sardonic; and a certain element of moodiness was seldom absent from his face. &quot;Kern is really a secret sufferer from the artistic temperament,&quot; said the managing editor once, &quot;but so long as he's trying to live it down, I won't give him away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Average Jones,&quot; the creation of Samuel Hopkins Adams, achieves a distinction by being inconspicuous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was, so to speak, a composite photograph of any thousand well-conditioned, clean living Americans between the ages of twenty-five and thirty. Happily, his otherwise commonplace face was relieved by the one unfailing characteristic of composite photographs, large, deep-set and thoughtful eyes. Otherwise he would have passed in any crowd, and nobody would have noticed him pass. Now, at twenty-seven, he looked back over the five years since his graduation from college and wondered what he had done with them; and at the four previous years of undergraduate life and wondered how he had done so well with those, and why he had not in some manner justified the parting words of his favorite professor: &quot;You have one rare faculty, Jones. You can, when you choose, sharpen the pencil of your mind to a very fine point. Specialize, my boy, specialize.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little like &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; is &quot;The Man in the Comer,&quot; described thus by the Baroness Orczy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultramorose fancy. Polly thought to herself that she had never seen anyone so pale, so thin, with such funny light-coloured hair, brushed very smoothly across the top of a very dubiously bald crown. He looked so timid and nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string; his long, lean, and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful and complicated proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astro, the hero of Gelett Burgess's book of Mystery Stories, is perhaps the farthest possible remove from a conventional detective in appearance. Though not described categorically, we are given various word pictures of him in his &quot;psychic studio.&quot; There he lounges among oriental divans and draperies, wearing a jewelled turban, flowing silken robes, and other characteristic apparel, as he indulges in the enjoyment of his silver-mounted water-pipe or his pet white lizard. He has sufficiently unusual eccentricities to put him in the list of correctly made up fiction detectives, and though blase, he is original and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idiosyncrasies-of-fictional-detectives&quot;&gt;Idiosyncrasies of Fictional Detectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fictional detectives have peculiar and individual tricks of personality which are doubtless intended for the reader to remember them by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dupin had the most pronouncedly queer traits of all. Perhaps none of his successors ever achieved anything so freakish as this described below; and which, had he lived to-day, would have given him a claim to the title of &quot;Sun Dodger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamoured of the night for her own sake, and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighted a couple of tapers, which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm and arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes' idiosyncrasies are too well known to need recapitulation. His morphine habit, his musical taste and his sardonic moods are familiar to all. Holmes also had a habit of listening to his clients' recitals with his eyes shut. Though to be sure this was less radical than the proceeding of Dupin who &quot;sat in his accustomed armchair, the embodiment of respectful attention&quot; but he wore green spectacles which allowed him to &quot;sleep not the less soundly, though silently&quot; throughout the long account of the case by the Prefect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holmes' odd habits are here referred to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and- tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humors would sit in an arm-chair with his hair- trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are, we must admit, unusual habits, but still Dr. Watson assures us that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Dr. Watson's suspicions were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq's eccentricity was his habit of silent communion with a portrait of his wife which he carried with him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq had recourse to the portrait on the lozenge- box. His look was more than a glance, it was a confidence. He was evidently saying something to the dear defunct, which he dared not utter aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This habit is also noted in Mr. Gryce. This delightful old gentleman had a way of addressing himself to any small inanimate object in his neighborhood. It might be an inkstand or a doorknob, but he treated it, to all appearance, as his guide, philosopher and friend. On one occasion he became very chummy with a statue at the foot of a staircase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whereupon I repeated my words, this time very quietly but clearly, while Mr. Gryce continued to frown at the bronze figure he had taken into his confidence. When I had finished, Mr. Van Burnam's countenance had changed, so had his manner. He held himself as erect as before, but not with as much bravado. He showed haste and impatience also, but not the same kind of haste and not quite the same kind of impatience. The corners of Mr. Gryce's mouth betrayed that he noted this change, but he did not turn away from the newel-post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, upon occasion, Mr. Gryce is unable to take active interest in the evidence being deposed by a witness because of his intense absorption in a &quot;close and confidential confab with his own finger-tips.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Cuff, however, has a very sane and pleasant fad of his own, but he puts it to its proper use when he employs it to evade impertinent or unwelcome queries. Instead of dashing madly into his &quot;investigations&quot; the celebrated detective goes off on a side track thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, you've got the right exposure here to the south and sou'west,&quot; says the Sergeant, with a wag of his grizzled head, and a streak of pleasure in his melancholy voice. &quot;This is the shape for a rosery—nothing like a circle set in a square. Yes, yes; with walks between all the beds. But they oughtn't to be gravel-walks like these. Grass, Mr. Gardener—grass-walks between your roses; gravel's too hard for them. That's a sweet pretty bed of white roses and blush roses. They always mix well together, don't they? Here's the white musk-rose, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Betteredge—our old English rose holding up his head along with the best and newest of them. Pretty dear!&quot; says the Sergeant, fondling the musk-rose with his lanky fingers, and speaking to it as if he were speaking to a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a nice sort of a man to recover Miss Rachel's Diamond, and to find out the thief who stole it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You seem to be fond of roses. Sergeant?&quot; I remarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven't much time to be fond of anything,&quot; says Sergeant Cuff. &quot;But, when I have a moment's fondness to bestow, most times, Mr. Betteredge, the roses get it. I began my life among them in my father's nursery garden, and I shall end my life among them if I can. Yes. One of these days (please God) I shall retire from catching thieves, and try my hand at growing roses. There will be grass-walks, Mr. Gardener, between my beds,&quot; says the Sergeant, on whose mind the gravel-paths of a rosery seemed to dwell unpleasantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It seems an odd taste, sir,&quot; I ventured to say, &quot;for a man in your line of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If you will look about you (which most people won't do),&quot; says Sergeant Cuff, &quot;you will see that the nature of a man's tastes is, most times, as opposite as possible to the nature of a man's business. Show me any two things more opposite one from the other than a rose and a thief, and I'll correct my tastes accordingly—if it isn't too late at my time of life. You find the damask-rose a good- ish stock for most of the tender sorts, don't you, Mr. Gardener? Ah! I thought so. Here's a lady coming. Is it Lady Verinder?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiarity of &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; and what gives him his title, is a curious vocal defect which at times prevents his audible speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;favorite-phrases-of-detectives&quot;&gt;Favorite Phrases of Detectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Thinking Machine,&quot; aside from his petulance and impatience, continually repeats two or three favorite phrases that annoy the reader quite as much as the clients annoy this astute detective. One of them is, &quot;Don't say it is impossible! that annoys me exceedingly! Nothing is impossible to the human mind!&quot; This assertion, innocent enough in itself, is so frequently repeated as to become intolerable. Another phrase of which Professor Van Dusen is inordinately fond, is, &quot;Two and two make four, not sometimes, but all the time.&quot; This also is repeated so often as to become tiresome. To quote the Professor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Two and two make four, not sometimes, but all the time,&quot; he began, at last as if disputing some previous assertion. &quot;As the figure two, wholly disconnected from any other, gives small indication of a result, so is an isolated fact of little consequence. Yet that fact added to another, and the resulting fact added to a third, and so on, will give a final result. That result, if every fact is considered must be correct. Thus any problem may be solved by logic; logic is inevitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, variations on a theme of two and two making four are hackneyed in detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a figure of speech, the proposition that two and two make four except in unusual cases, is fair enough. It is paraphrased thus: in &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can't s'y as I know anythink about it, sir, but by puttin' two and two together it makes four sometimes—not always.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite right. You're a philosopher. Let me hear the two two's. We'll see about the addition afterwards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is humorously referred to in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; by Mary Roberts Rinehart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point in my story, Halsey always says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Trust a woman to add two and two together, and make six&quot; To which I retort that if two and two plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world. That a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same proposition is quoted as the keynote of a detective's method in &quot;The Holladay Case&quot; where, in praise of the detective, it is remarked, &quot;Your work convinced us that you know how to put two and two together, which is more than can be said for the ordinary mortal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &quot;The House Opposite&quot; the detective declares that to succeed in his profession requires, &quot;accurate and most minute powers of observation, unlimited patience, and a capacity for putting two and two together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes shows a grasp of the principle, when he says, &quot;If you were asked to prove that two and two make four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe disdained the simple reference to two plus two, but embodied a similar idea in this subtle manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that X squared plus px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where X squared plus px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspiring author, then, will do well to omit further references to the adding of two and two as an illuminating point in his story. Eccentricities or freakish habits on the part of his detective are permissible if not harped upon too continuously. But let them be of a pleasant or at least of an unobjectionable nature, and not like a habit attributed to a detective in a series of stories now current, who pulled at the lobe of his ear, until a fastidious reader was fain to close the book in disgust. Let the habits of your hero be whimsical, mysterious, or erratic, if you choose; but let them be agreeable and not too frequently reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plot-is-the-story&quot;&gt;The Plot is the Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the detective story, short or long, has but one plot—the problem and its solution. No matter what elaboration may be introduced, the skeleton of the plot is the same; and it is this simplicity of construction, this straight and narrow path of procedure, that makes the writing of detective stories both easy and hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bliss Perry eliminates the necessity in some stories, and by some writers for any characterization or setting whatever. He says, in &quot;A Study of Prose Fiction:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If its plot be sufficiently entertaining, comical, novel, thrilling, the characters may be the merest lay figures and yet the story remains an admirable work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poe's tales of ratiocination, as he loved to call them, like &quot;The Gold Bug,&quot; &quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; or his tales of pseudo-science, like &quot;A Descent into the Maelstrom,&quot; are dependent for none of their power upon any interest attaching to character. The exercise of the pure logical faculty, or the wonder and the terror of the natural world, gives scope enough for that consummate craftsman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in his &quot;Talks on Writing English&quot; Arlo Bates observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a crude popular idea that the refinements of literary art are wasted, at any rate upon the general reader. So many books succeed, at least temporarily, which can make no slightest pretence to any grace of manner, and which have not even the merit of reasonable accuracy, that the student is apt to feel that these things are superfluous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have shown earlier in the book that while a detective story, even if poorly written, may interest and amuse, it is not literature unless it shows that superiority of intellectual attainment demanded by the critics or scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;constructing-the-plot&quot;&gt;Constructing the Plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But referring now to the plot, let the young writer be careful that he plans his story with absolute logic and sequence. Poe tells us that it was his &quot;design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referable either to accident or intuition; that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accept Poe as the master in this field of fiction, and we can do no better than to study both his own stories and his essays in criticism of them. He makes this definite statement regarding the plotting of a story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing is more clear than that every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its denouement before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the denouement constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building a story, then, let us construct it entirely from start to finish before beginning its actual diction. Construct the plot backward, if need be; but see to it that every incident and every episode, every speech of the characters and every hint of the author have their direct bearing on the statement of the problem or the quest of its solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another valuable point in construction given us by Poe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The design of mystery, however, being once determined upon by an author, it becomes imperative, first that no undue or inartistical means be employed to conceal the secret of the plot; and, secondly, that the secret be well kept. Now, when, at page 16, we read that &quot;the body of poor Mr. Rudge, the steward, was found&quot; months after the outrage, etc., we see that Mr. Dickens has been guilty of no misdemeanor against art in stating what was not the fact; since the falsehood is put into the mouth of Solomon Daisy, and given merely as the impression of thus individual and of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The writer has not asserted it in his own person, but ingeniously conveyed an idea (false in itself, yet a belief in which is necessary for the effect of the tale) by the mouth of one of his characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The case is different, however, when Mrs. Rudge is repeatedly denominated &quot;the widow.&quot; It is the author who, himself, frequently so terms her. This is disingenuous and inartistical; accidentally so, of course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exactly parallel idea to this may be noticed in &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; Harwell, the private secretary, is a witness at the inquest. Also, he is the murderer. In the very beginning of the book the question is put to him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are the person who last saw Mr. Leavenworth alive, are you not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are then told that the young man raised his head with a haughty gesture that well nigh transfigured it, and replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Certainly not; as I am not the man who killed him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, he was the man who killed him, and had the author told the reader he was not, it would have been infringing on the rights of the reader. But it is perfectly legitimate that the character in the book should make this false statement, by way of not incriminating himself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this device the reader is not only convinced that this Harwell is innocent, but feels a warming sympathy toward the suspected man. Harwell's status now being established in the reader's mind, as that of injured innocence, he is at liberty to figure prominently all through the book, yet never arouse the reader's sleeping suspicion until the author so wills it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is a strong one to a conscientious writer of detective fiction—to learn at the end of the volume that the real culprit is the person who has been before you throughout, but whom you never have dreamed of suspecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is an adept in the use of this plan, and surpasses most other writers in her ability to carry her unsuspected criminal straight through the book to the last page. In reading &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; who would guess that Lawyer Orcutt was the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens? The thrilling story goes on, and the reader successively suspects Hildreth, Mansell, or any character in the book rather than Orcutt, the grave and aristocratic lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this surprise, when at last the identity of the criminal is learned, that is the crux of the Detective Story. Observation and deduction, though important in interest, are side issues of the plot—which must bend all else to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; who would guess or even deduce that the clever detective is himself the criminal? Note how deftly he is introduced to the reader, because &quot;he is destined to play a large and most romantic part in the solution of the mystery, and his queer, brilliant, eccentric personality is to appear very often in the ensuing pages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this hint gives the reader no suspicion that the man thus introduced is really the criminal, nor does he suspect it until the very last. This book is rather more subtly constructed than &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; in that the motive for the crime is shown in the beginning of the book; though so skilfully veiled that even an experienced reader might be excused for not discerning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author, Henry Kitchell Webster, calls this his favorite of all the books he has written. He says, and very truly, that &quot;he has played fair with his readers, given them every bit of information — all the clues to the identity of the person who committed the crime — that he himself has, but managing to lead their attention away from the real culprit until the desired moment for climax and revelation has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In this kind of story when the big smash comes the reader should be able to go back in the story, and having reread all that goes up to the climax be able to unravel each clue which leads to the climax.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the true spirit of the writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintaining-suspense&quot;&gt;Maintaining Suspense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another and very necessary point to remember is that the mystery must be of sufficient interest to be worth unraveling. To quote Anna Katharine Green on her methods of construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I must have a central idea which appeals to my imagination; and an end of such point or interest that the reader will feel that it justifies the intricacies which are introduced to hold it back. In other words the heart of the labyrinth must be worth reaching.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course refers especially to books, where more intricacies must be introduced than in a short-story. Mr. Burton E. Stevenson, a successful writer of detective fiction, professes these principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;First, to play fair with the reader, the cards must all lie on the table. It isn't honest to keep any up your sleeve; and the problem is to surprise the reader by the unexpected way in which you combine them. The reader must have before him all the facts which the solver of the mystery has, and then the 'Solver' must get there first. I also refuse to make any person act suspiciously without cause. If the person is innocent there is no reason why he should behave as though he were guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I think perhaps my particular trick is to keep the reader in suspense not so much as to what is going to happen as to how it is going to happen. I may add that it also seems necessary to me that every mystery should be approached from at least two angles; say, an amateur detective and a professional one, for instance; and that a great part of the interest of the story lies in the conflict between them, victory leaning first toward one and then toward the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I start a story I write it clear through, working regularly every day, (though it takes the lash sometimes) and then going back to do the dovetailing. There must be no loose ends; every joint must fit and there must be no superfluous lumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A detective story ought to run a swift, straight course from start to finish. It isn't a leisurely stroll through the country, it's a hundred yard dash! And you may have noted that in &quot;The Boule Cabinet&quot; there isn't a hint of love interest; love interest is dead weight unless it is an essential part of the plot; and one can't carry much dead weight and win a hundred yard dash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stevenson succinctly expresses the true principles of detective fiction; and by adhering to these, the young writer is travelling in the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nevil Monroe Hopkins—whose detective, &quot;Mason Brant,&quot; operates in &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. North,&quot; and other novelettes—writes thus on the same subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I endeavor to start right off with action and to maintain it throughout, introducing such interesting characters and atmosphere as I can. I try to have a novel plot and to make most of the characters talk to each other in a direct manner; and to have some of the meeting-places, at least, rather gruesome. I endeavor also to have a golden thread of love and romance running from start to finish, upon which to string the more unwholesome elements which are necessary to contribute effectively to the phases of mystery. I believe always in writing deductively, in visiting queer places, and in accumulating acquaintances among police officials, doctors, lawyers, coroners, and the like.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see that the advisability of romance in detective stories is a matter of opinion, and opinions differ among the authorities. But the love interest, if not overdone, may be left to the discretion of the author, remembering that the mystery is the primary interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-the-story&quot;&gt;Planning the Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Kitchell Webster gives perhaps a more definite formula than those above quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEFORE WRITING:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Plan original crime, method, and motive of the murderer. 2. Create, with this as a nucleus, sub-plots relating to several persons who by coincidence are drawn to the place or are connected with the victim, in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THEN WRITE:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Introduction. 2. Murder discovery. 3.Then take up the least likely suspect first, followed by others. 4. Hero Detective enters, decides, arrests and explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gelett Burgess constructs his stories by architectural diagrams. The first story in his book, &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; (published anonymously) is &quot;The Missing John Hudson&quot;—We subjoin its preliminary plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostL&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;GBurgess&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/GBurgess-construct.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another well-known writer gives this very definite formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Preliminaries. Status quo. Introduction of dramatis personae.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Birth of Plot. Assembly of actors and assignment of parts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tentative separation of sheep from goats, intentionally misleading.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Crime—shot into the story like a bomb.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Gropings for murderer, on part of the police, coroner, friends, relatives and amateur detective.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Failure of everybody. Call in Transcendent Detective.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;He glances about, announces that the facts are thus and so and proves that the facts are thus and so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Discreet removal of the villain by suicide, accident or otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Marriage of the girl to the amateur detective. (This is invariable and imperative!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The last item is in satiric vein, for among our best writers it is not considered imperative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the foregoing formulae, kindly contributed by their authors, cannot fail to be of use to the beginning writer of Detective Stories. They all agree in the principal points, and are quite in line with Poe's strict laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rights of the reader must be kept in mind by the author. It is not fair to mislead the reader until he is up against a blank wall. A false clue must lead in an obvious and seemingly logical direction. Then the false clue must be detected, as a natural consequence of the mistaken lead, and the right clues brought into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not fair to make an innocent character appear guilty or vice versa, but it is quite right if the character make himself appear so. A witness who stammers and hesitates, may be guilty or may be innocently embarrassed. That is for the reader to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just in proportion to the cleverness and subtlety of the author's inventive genius, will the reader be duly and rightfully bewildered, or misled, and the game be well played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Max Dessoir, in a very fine article on &quot;The Psychology of Conjuring,&quot; writes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;By awakening interest in some unimportant detail, the conjurer concentrates that attention on some false point, or negatively, diverts it from the main object, and we all know the senses of an inattentive person are pretty dull … When causing the disappearance of some object, the conjurer counts one, two, three, because, the attention of the public being diverted to three, they do not notice what happens at one and two … A specially successful method of diversion is founded on the human craze for imitation … The conjurer counts on this in many cases. He always looks in the direction where he wants the attention of the public, and does everything himself which he wants the public to do … If the trick is in the left hand, the conjurer turns sharply to the person to the right, presuming correctly that the spectators will make the same movement, and will not notice what is going on in the left hand … Every sharp, short remark will, for a moment, at least, divert the eyes from the hands and direct them to the mouth, according to the above-mentioned law of imitation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These most valuable directions may be helpfully adapted to the writing of Detective Stories. The author is, in a way, a conjuror, with an avowed intent to hoodwink his audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Stories call for logic, plausibility and a true sense of proportion. Literary ability is to be desired; but before that, there must be power of deduction and a perfect sense of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-humor&quot;&gt;The Question of Humor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If romance is out of place in a detective story, humor is even more so. With the exception of the whimsical De Quincey and the waggish Zangwill, few can write or read about murder with any touch of humor. The best Detective Stories are absolutely void of it, and except in the hands of a whimsical genius it is entirely out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zangwill wrote only one Detective Story, but that one is unique; and in plot far and away cleverer than any tale of a Transcendent Detective. Though professing to care little for this Detective Story of his, he says in the preface to its second edition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Big Bow Mystery' seems to me an excellent murder story, as murder stories go, for, while as sensational as the most of them, it contains more humor and character creation than the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the humor is too abundant. Mysteries should be sedate and sober. There should be a pervasive atmosphere of horror and awe such as Poe manages to create. Humor is out of tone; it would be more artistic to preserve a somber note throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I was a realist in those days, and in real life mysteries occur to real persons with their individual humors, and mysterious circumstances are apt to be complicated by comic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-unique-devices&quot;&gt;Some Unique Devices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique plot in which the unsuspected criminal is ever before us is &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux. This astonishing story depends on two absolutely original propositions. One, that the attempt at murder in an inaccessible room occurred long before it was supposed to have done so. The other that the great and celebrated detective who condescends to take the case is really the criminal. But the workmanship of this story and the several and perfect surprises can only be appreciated by reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in all probability the great desire of the detective writer to choose for his criminal the character least likely to be suspected, that first suggested making the criminal of the story the detective also. Surely the last person the reader would suspect would be the detective. This has been frequently done of late, indeed so frequently as to cause great danger of this plot's losing its effectiveness. For the astute reader, always ready to learn the latest trick, has even now begun to suspect the least likely one for the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Accomplice,&quot; by F.T. Hill, the criminal is the prosecuting attorney, which is in itself a clever idea, and gives scope for beautifully misleading incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, then, marshal your characters tentatively and select the one seemingly impossible as a criminal. Give him a plausible and adequate motive. Give him opportunity. Give him intelligence and ability to hide his traces; and then go on, using every sidelight and every tiny clue possible, gently to persuade your reader, but never to force him, to a false conclusion; and then at the last spring your surprise suddenly and drop the curtain at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more annoying to the trained reader than a long chapter of explanation after the revelation. We have sometimes more than one chapter of the dead criminal's written confession, and our wonder and curiosity also being dead, we take little interest in the perusal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless this post-mortem confession is inevitable to your plot, so arrange it that the motives and methods are explained just before the climax instead of just after, Conan Doyle beautifully escaped this situation in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; by reserving Sherlock Holmes' explanation of his own work until after the long and wearisome interpolation revealing the motive of the crime. The reader waded through, or skimmed through those chapters, because spurred on by his desire to learn the resolution of the problem, to which he knew the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Conan Doyle is not at his best in mystery novels. The short-story is his forte. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; the author realizes often that the action must be retarded, and Sherlock Holmes for once in his life is obliged to bungle. About a third of the way through the book. Holmes indulges in a shrug and a rueful smile. &quot;Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,&quot; said he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in a short-story would he have made his third thread snap, nor would he, indeed, have had any third thread; the first would have led to the desired goal. But in a book, threads must be multiplied and snapped and tangled to make the larger web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; we are treated to descriptions of scenery. We learn that &quot;Rolling pasture lands curved upwards on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit country-side there rose, ever dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.&quot; In a short-story these things would have been left to the imagination, for lack of room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that, in the book, unnecessary though acceptable characters had to be introduced, such as Selden and his wife's brother. A love interest is introduced around the beautiful Miss Stapleton. The device of Watson's diary report is introduced to delay the decisions of Sherlock Holmes. And the mysterious &quot;L.L.&quot; is invented for the same reason. But so accustomed is Conan Doyle to the quick action of a short-story that these forced delays hamper him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is, however, exceedingly clever in palming off his own desires for delay upon his characters; as for instance in the following detail of Holmes' character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of Sherlock Holmes's defects—if, indeed, one may call it a defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfillment. Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the real reason for Holmes' silence during that long, dark drive was because if he had told all he knew, the story would have ended then and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is characteristic of Conan Doyle, the denouement of this story entirely satisfies the reader. The exceedingly bizarre conception of this supernatural hound is logically and rationally explained. Moreover, and the young writer would do well to note this point, the criminal is summarily and inconspicuously disposed of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always unpleasant to contemplate the hanging or the electrocuting of the fiction criminal. For this reason he not infrequently takes poison (which he has ready in his pocket), as soon as he is discovered, and dies peacefully, close upon the last words of his confession. This is one of the conventions adopted to spare the reader's feelings. For a criminal that can hold the reader's interest throughout the story is often too attractive a character to be permitted a horrible taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these conventions and devices and unwritten laws of the technique of the Mystery Story can only be learned—or, at least, can best be learned—from the thoughtful reading of the works of the masters in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty and value of these creations cannot be appreciated by the casual or untrained reader. Only a connoisseur in the art of detective fiction can appreciate and intelligently enjoy the skill with which a great author plays with his readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be likened to the skilled fisherman playing with trout. Or perhaps it is better symbolized by these remarks of the Great Herrman when speaking of his handcuff tricks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Common sense alone does not entitle a person to judge competently of the safety of fetters; only the man who is familiar with the technique of knots and the different ways of tying can express an opinion. To decide whether a closure is right or not, requires technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most people imagine that they can go unprepared to a spiritualistic seance, and pass a correct opinion on the existence or nonexistence of prestidigitation. This standpoint is as childish as when a layman expresses himself on the genuineness of the seal of the middle ages or on the nature of a nervous affection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, the reader who is unversed in the arts and crafts of detective fiction cannot be expected to value the skill shown in the great presentations of The Problem and its Solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~
